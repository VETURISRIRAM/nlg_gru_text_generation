do you know what time it is
cant sleep
there are tabs for that
yeah but then id be sleeping
dreams again
wanna fight
i slipped
right you slipped
as a result of me punching you in the face
i was already slipping
when you happened to punch me in the face
the two events were not related
tell me about this dream
 anything new  no
you have to let go of the past
i dont remember my past
its causing you doubt
and doubt makes you vulnerable
control it
lose control again and youll have to commune
with the supreme intelligence
theres nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion
humor is a distraction
and anger
anger only serves the enemy
one hundred twenty days
since the last skrull attack
has anyone ever seen
what the supreme intelligence really looks like
no one can look upon the supreme intelligence
in its true form
you know that
our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us
so its sacred its personal
no kree divulges it ever
who do you see
 your brother  no
 father  no
 your old commander  vers
its me you see isnt it
i see what youre trying to do
 is it working  yes
but you wont succeed in changing the subject
what is the point of giving me these
if you dont want me to use them
i want you to use them
the supreme intelligence gave me a responsibility
of showing you how to use them
i know how
yeah if that were true youd be able to
knock me down without them
control your impulses
stop using this start using this
i want you to be the best version of yourself
vers
intelligence
your commander insists that youre fit to serve
i am
you struggle with your emotions
with your past which fuels them
you are just one victim of the skrull expansion
that has threatened our civilization for centuries
imposters who silently infiltrate
then take over our planets
horrors that you remember
and so much that you do not
its all blank my life
youre supposed to take the form
of who i most admire
but i dont even remember who this person was to me
perhaps this is a mercy
sparing you from a deeper pain
freeing you to do what all kree must
put your peoples needs before your own
weve given you a great gift
the chance to fight for the good of all kree
i want to serve
then master yourself
what was given can be taken away
i wont let you down
well know soon enough
you have a mission
serve well and with honor
this cant be good
must be another skrull attack
whatever it is its big
has a skrull ever simmed you
once
 it was deeply disturbing  why
because i stared into the face of my mortal enemy
and the face staring back was my own
maybe if you were more attractive
then it would be less disturbing
you think youre funny but im not laughing
you never laugh
i laugh on the inside
im not doing that now
its funny cause objectively speaking
youre quite handsome
well thank you
listen up team knock it off
all right
prepare for
a search and rescue of our spy sohlarr
the skrulls have invaded yet another border planet
this time torfa
sohlarr sent us a warning
the signal was intercepted and his covers blown
the skrull general talos
has sent kill units to find him
should they reach him before we do
the intelligence hes acquired
over three years is as good as theirs
the accusers will bomb
a skrull stronghold here in the south
we slip in we locate sohlarr
and we get out leaving them none the wiser
the torfan populace
we are not to interfere with them
nor them with us
nothing compromises the security of our mission
proceed with caution
follow protocol before extracting him
this is a dangerous mission
we must all be ready to join the collective
if that is our fate today
for the good of all kree
for the good of all kree

and everything were after
oh
that did something

nothing that wasnt already there
but those arent my memories
yeah its like a bad trip isnt it
im not surprised you cant keep it straight
they really did a number on you
enough of your mind games
what do you want
were looking for the location of a dr lawson

thats impossible
that code was buried in his unconscious
the skrulls messed with my mind

i think its how they extracted sohlarrs code
vers where are you
im on planet c53
the skrulls are looking for someone named lawson
who
shes who i see
shes what
vers
vers what
shes a scientist
they think that shes cracked the code on lightspeed tech
i have to get to her before they do
or else theyll be able to invade new galaxies
no youve been caught once already
how far is c53
closest jump point is 22 hours
vers hold your position until we get there
keep your comms online so we can contact you
no what if they get a hold of it before

hey rookie go talk to the rentacop

shapeshifters
they can transform into any lifeform down to the dna
oh boy you guys dont have any clue do you
whoa whoa whoa hold on
how do we know youre not one of those shapeshifters
congratulations agent fury
you have finally asked a relevant question
no congratulations to you starforce lady
youre under arrest
rook
rook lets roll
did you see her weapon
i did not
watch it
suspect on northbound train in pursuit
trust me true believer trust me
trust me true believer
get off
trains heading for a tunnel up ahead
lets greet them at the station
mr fury this is agent coulson
uh im still here at the blockbuster
and uh whered everybody go
i finished collecting evidence
we need an ambulance
someone call 911
hey you all right
oh my gosh is everyone okay
anyone else see that
official shield activity stay back
nice scuba suit
lighten up honey huh
got a smile for me
freak
all life on earth is carbonbased not this guy
whatever he runs on
its not on the periodic table
youre saying hes not from around here
hey hows your eye
well id say fine
but it cant believe what its seeing
you say this thing looked like coulson
mmm talked like him too
and the woman said that there were more
the word she used was infiltration
you believe her
not till i saw this
whats your plan
ill find blockbuster girl
i got word on a motorcycle thief
that fits her description
if she can tell us why these lizards are here
maybe she can tell us how to kick em to the curb
good
do it alone though we cant trust anyone
not even our own men
yes sir
wow theyre ugly bastards arent they
yeah well hes no brad pitt sir
safe journey to the beyond my friend
i will finish what we started
i wouldnt get too close there boss
no one in or out
boom
what can i get ya
where was this photograph taken
an airport
wheres pegasus
thats classified
not unlike the file i started on you
but i see youve changed it up a bit since then
grunge is a good look for you
did you have a rough day agent fury
it was cool you know
had a space invasion big car chase
got to watch an alien autopsy
typical ninetofive
so you saw one
i was never one to believe in aliens
but i cant unsee that
this is gonna get a little awkward but i gotta ask
you think im one of those green things
cant be too careful
you are looking at 100 redblooded earth man
im afraid im gonna need proof
we talking cheek swab or urine sample
no the dna would match
want my aol password
skrulls can only sim recent memories
 of their host bodies  oh oh
you wanna get personal
 where were you born  huntsville alabama
but technically i dont remember that part
 name of your first pet  mr snoofers
 mr snoofers  thats what i said
do i pass
not yet first job
soldier straight out of high school
left the ranks a full bird colonel
 then  spy
 where  it was the cold war
we were everywhere
uh belfast bucharest belgrade budapest
i like the bs i can make them rhyme
 now  been riding a desk
for the past six years
trying to figure out where our
future enemies are coming from
never occurred to me
they would be coming from above
name a detail so bizarre
a skrull could never fabricate it
if toast is cut diagonally i cant eat it
you didnt need that did you
no no i didnt but i enjoyed it
okay your turn
prove youre not a skrull
and how is that supposed to prove to me
youre not a skrull
thats a photon blast
and
a skrull cant do that
so a full bird colonel
turned spy turned shield agent
must have pretty high security clearance
wheres pegasus
okay the skrulls sim alien races
to infiltrate and take over planets
and youre a kree a race of noble warriors
heroes noble warrior heroes
so um what do skrulls want with dr lawson
they believe that she developed
a lightspeed engine at pegasus
lightspeed engine
gotta admit thats not
the craziest thing ive heard today
well its still early
and you what do you want
to stop the skrulls before they become unstoppable
and
look war is a universal language
i know a rogue soldier when i see one
you got a personal stake in this
this is government property
turn your vehicle around
nicholas joseph fury agent of shield
place your thumb on the pad
one moment
nicholas joseph fury you have three names
everybody calls me fury
not nicholas not joseph not nick just fury
 what does your mom call you  fury
 what do you call her  fury
what about your kids
if i have them theyll call me fury
you are cleared for access
thank you
oh hold up
you look like somebodys disaffected niece
put that on
 what is it  its the shield logo
does uh announcing your identity on clothing
help with the covert part of your job
said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit
lose the flannel
how can i help you
were agents of shield
were looking for a woman named lawson
a dr wendy lawson
do you know her
follow me
hmm
you familiar with the phrase welcome wagon
no
well this aint it
is that a communicator
yeah stateoftheart twoway pager
who are you paging
my mom dont worry i didnt mention you
after you
impressive
oh you should see what i can do with a paperclip
hey there how are you
oh my goodness look at you just look at you
arent you the cutest little thing
arent you cute and whats your name huh
whats your name
goose cool name for a cool cat
fury
hmm
ill be back
oh let me get my fingerprint out
just let me unravel this puppy
you sat there and watched me play with tape
when all you had to do was
i didnt wanna steal your thunder
huh lawson
lawsons plan for the lightspeed engine
i wonder why they terminated the project
um maybe because shes cuckoo
kree glyphs
hmm
lawson is not cuckoo
shes kree
well shes dead
what
she crashed the asis aircraft
doing an unauthorized test flight
took a pilot down with her
thats why security here is so unfriendly
theyre covering up a billiondollar mistake
oh and your lightspeed engine is toast
when did this crash happen
six years ago 1989
who was the pilot
um most of this things redacted
but there is a testimonial here from a maria rambeau
last person to see them alive
you okay
mmhmm
back in a minute
this isnt about fighting wars
its about ending them
i know lawson was kree
she was here on c53 and died in a plane crash
do you know anything about this
i just discovered a mission report
sent from c53
theres only so much
im cleared to tell you vers but
lawson was an undercover kree operative named marvell
she was working on a unique energy core
experimenting with tech
that apparently could help us win the war
she still here
shes cooperating with the investigation sir
 you men stay here  yes sir
i want to question her alone
excellent work nicholas
does it say anything about me
anything about you no of course not
why would it
i found evidence that i had a life here
on c53
marvell is who i see
when i visit the supreme intelligence
i knew her and i knew her as lawson
this sounds like skrull simulation vers
no its not because i remember i was here
stop remember your training
know your enemy it could be you
do not let your emotions override your judgment
shes on sublevel six
ill get off on five
and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it
do a pincer move like we did in havana
right like we did in havana
were nearing the jump point
leave your beacon on so i can find you
well get to the bottom of this vers
together
okay
vers
vers
furys colluding with the target
then why would he call us in
all i know is we take him in too
dead or alive
dead or alive
go go go
was it something i said
mmmmmm
now you know i dont really need these to see
but they do kinda complete the look
dont you think
you called them in
my bad
coulson do you have eyes on them
theyre not down here
lets try up there
 what  your communicator
you obviously cant be trusted with it
do you know how to fly this thing
uh well see
thats a yes or no question
yes
thats what im talking about
we got a stowaway
hang on goose
goose
no goose
whos a good kitty huh huh goose
yes thats right
whos a good kitty goose
you the good kitty thats right
see anyone you know
funny story
i arrived on hala near dead no memory
that was six years ago
so you think youre the pilot
that went down with dr lawson
im saying the last person to see them alive
could probably tell us
 maria rambeau  mmhmm
so how do we get to louisiana
due east hang a right at memphis
that agent
that stopped the skrulls from finding us
coulson the new guy
i guess he doesnt hate me yet
yeah well give him time
i guess he had a feeling you know
went with his gut against orders
thats a really hard thing to do
but its what keeps us human
i get in trouble for that a lot
oh i can see that about you
rescuing the guy who sold you out to the skrulls
im guessing thats not
standard kree operating procedure
well i wont tell your boss if you dont tell mine
ronan
the accusers completed their operation
but the greater mission was a failure
thanks to your team
it was a trap
to lure our operative vers to torfa and kidnap her
give us their location
well take care of the terrorist threat
by bombing them out of the galaxy
no well handle this
a cell of skrulls anywhere
is a threat to kree everywhere
where are they
 they are  lost
they are lost for now
but we will find them
do so or we will
maintain the course for c53
excuse me im looking for maria rambeau
auntie carol
mom its auntie carol
i knew it everyone said you were dead
but we knew they were lying
im not really who you think i am
that is the craziest shit i ever heard
green transforming aliens theres no such thing
you are absolutely right young lady
there is no such thing
cause if there were
we would want to keep that to ourselves
you dont believe me
no way
thats so cool
oh she can do a lot more than make tea
with those hands
like what show us
maybe later
i kept all your stuff
ill go get it
you want to give her a hand with that
hmm
you dont remember anything
i see flashes
little moments
but i cant tell whats real
if i could just piece together what happened that morning
maybe itll all make sense
you woke me up banging on my door at dawn
your usual move
back then we had to get up so early
the air force still wasnt letting women fly combat
so testing lawsons planes was our only shot
at doing something that mattered
you wanted to race to base in your old mustang
and i wasnt about to argue
cause i knew my camaro would dominate
but you cheated took a shortcut
since when is a shortcut cheating
since it violates the predetermined
rules of engagement
i definitely dont remember those
hmm of course you dont
when i got to the hangar lawson was agitated
she said she had lives to save
she was trying to take the asis up herself
but you said that
if there were lives at stake i would fly the plane
yeah yep big hero moment
the kind of moment wed both been waiting for
the doc was always unique thats why we liked her
but now youre saying shes from another planet
i know this must be hard for you
oh what this part right here
no no mmmmmm
oh whats hard is losing my best friend
in a mission so secret
they act like it never even happened
hard is knowing you were out there somewhere
too damn stubborn to die
and now you come up in here after six years
with your supercharged fire hands
and you expect me to call you
i dont even know what vers
is that really who you are now
i dont know
come look
this is me and you on halloween
im amelia earhart and youre janis joplin
oh this is you when you were little
you didnt get along with your parents
so mom said we became your real family
this is us on christmas
i got my favorite bunny slippers
this is another picture of you when you were little
youve always wanted to be a pilot
and this is right after you graduated
this was your dog that you got for christmas
this is a picture of everybody from your air force team
and this is you with mom
right after a good day of training
these were your three favorite guys
oh wait i forgot
your jacket
mom doesnt let me wear it anymore
after i spilled ketchup on it
that was all that survived the crash
or so we thought
dont answer that
its just my neighbor
they can change into anyone
hi there
what do you want
 uh  hey tom
this is my friend carol
oh pleased to meet you
yowzers
static electricity out heres no joke
i noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road
and i was just wondering
if you mind if i bring the boys over
to get a closer looksee
 a closer looksee  yeah
to see the bird parked out by the road
mmm
youre really working overtime
to sell this one arent you talos
im sorry tom this really isnt a good time
ill come by tomorrow okay
 uh  okay
you know you really should be kinder to your neighbors
you never know when youre gonna need
to borrow some sugar
now hang on a second
before you go swinging those jazz hands around
making a mess of your friends house
its a lovely home miss
oh my god
what the hell
no ones gonna hurt the girl
just dont kill me
that would really complicate the situation
im about five seconds from complicating that wall
with some uglyass skrull brains
im sorry i simmed your boss
but now i stand before you as my true self
without deception
and who is that out there
okay thats a fair point
but im sure that you understand
i had to take some precautions
i saw you crush 20 of my best men
with your hands bound
i just wanna talk
last time we talked
i ended up hanging from my ankles
that was before i knew who you were
before i knew what made you different from the others
i have an audio recording from pegasus
of your voice from a plane crash
six years ago
on a device i believe you call a black box
they told me it was destroyed in the crash
howd you get it
she dont understand
young lady i have a special skill
that kind of allows me
to get into places im not supposed to be
call me young lady again
im gonna put my foot in a place
its not supposed to be
am i supposed to guess where that is
your ass
okay i get it were all a little on edge here
but look i just need your help
decoding some coordinates
if youll sit down and youll listen to this
i assure you itll be worth your while
call your buddy back inside and ill listen
deal
oh my god get that thing away
howd that get in here
hmm
the cat
this isnt what youre afraid of is it
thats not a cat
 thats a flerken  a flerken
mom
monica
 why cant i listen too  shh
whats happening
its loading
punch in the coordinates
5229 negative 47 8768 02
copy that where are we going doc
my laboratory
your laboratory what do you mean
oh no
is that wait what is that
its not showing up on my radar
go carol fly
thats no mig lawson who the hell are they
those are the bad guys fly faster now
yes maam
 what do they want  me my work
i never should have brought you along
here come some gs
theyre firing backwards hold on
bail out bail out bail out
stay with me lawson
carol come in do you copy
yeah i copy we hit ground
carol are you okay do you copy
yeah i copy
doc
your blood
its blue
yeah but uh hows my hair
help me out will ya
i gotta destroy it before they get here
lawson
you remember what i said about our work here
what its for
to end wars
yeah but the wars are bigger than you know
damn it
my name is not lawson
my real name is marvell
and i come from a planet called hala
i would say that youre delusional
but we just got shot down by a spaceship
and your blood is blue
listen i spent half my life fighting a shameful war
now skedaddle before you give me
any more regrets
just remember the coordinates okay
you gotta save em without me
save who how
now i gotta blow this engine before they find it
what are you doing
we have no interest in hurting you
no
cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression
the energy core
where is it
pararescues on the way
you have two minutes until youre surrounded
then i see no reason to prolong this conversation
no wait
you mean that energy core
no
commander shes still moving permission to fire
hold your fire
theres nothing left
the core has been destroyed
she absorbed its power
shes coming with us
he lied to me
everything that i knew was a lie
now you understand
what what do i understand now
yonrogg killed marvell
he killed her
cause she found out that she was
on the wrong side of an unjust war
no
your people are terrorists
they kill innocents
i saw the ruins on torfa
ruins that the accusers are responsible for
my people lived as refugees on torfa
homeless ever since we resisted kree rule
and they destroyed our planet
and the handful of us that are left
will be slaughtered next
unless you help me finish what marvell started
the core that she found
would have powered a lightspeed ship
capable of carrying us to safety
a new home where the kree cant reach us
lawson always told us that our work at pegasus
wasnt to fight wars
but to end them
she wanted you to help us find the core
well i already destroyed it
no you destroyed the engine
the core that powered it is in a remote location
if you help us decode those coordinates
we can find it
youll use it to destroy us
we just want a home
you and i lost everything at the hands of the kree
cant you see it now
youre not one of them
you dont know me
you have no idea who i am
i dont even know who i am
you are carol danvers
you are the woman on that black box
risking her life to do the right thing
my best friend
who supported me as a mother and a pilot
when no one else did
you are smart and funny and a huge pain in the ass
and you were the most powerful person i knew
way before you could shoot fire from your fists
you hear me
do you hear me
come here come here girl
i got you
i know i dont deserve your trust
but you were our only lead
we discovered that your energy signature
matched marvells core
now we know why
if only you knew the importance of it to me
i just need your help
decoding the coordinates to marvells lab
those werent coordinates theyre state vectors
for orbital position and velocity
you didnt find her lab on earth
cause its not on earth
that was the location
on the date of the crash six years ago
if we track its course
well find it in orbit right now
its just basic physics
in orbit
was that so difficult to figure out
i mean youre my science guy right
yonrogg will catch up to me soon
weve got to get to the core before he does
mmm were going to space
in what
a few tweaks to your vessel should do it
i can handle the modifications
mmm your science guy
well i could use a copilot
no no i cant
i cant leave monica
mom its okay i can stay with gramma and pawpaw
theres no way im going baby its too dangerous
testing brandnew aerospace tech is dangerous
and you used to do that
your plan is to leave the atmosphere
in a craft not designed for the journey
and you anticipate hostile encounters
with a technologicallysuperior
foreign enemy
correct
thats what im saying
 you have to go  monica
you have a chance to fly the coolest mission
in the history of missions
and youre gonna give it up to sit on the couch
and watch fresh prince with me
what
i just think you should consider
what kind of example youre setting for your daughter
whats going on around here
i know i know
ill explain inside thank you
your moms lucky
when they were handing out kids
they gave her the toughest one
lieutenant trouble
you remembered
is that mine
no no
you hang on to it until i come back
but there is something that i need your help with
i cant wear these kree colors anymore
and since you are obviously the only person around here
with any sense of style
hmm
whoa
no
uhuh
definitely not
well since were on the same team
hmm
how do i look
fresh
what took you so long

okay then lets do this
who do i see when i commune with the supreme intelligence

what have you done with her
youre too late
she knows
ronan skrulls have infiltrated c53
come at once
for the good of all kree commander
the infestation will be eradicated
passing 500 and climbing

our little alliance with you is tenuous at best
and as long as he continues to freak you out
like that
yeah im gonna keep giving him
all the loves and hugs that he needs right
can i ask you something
do you just turn into anything you want

a venus flytrap
ill give you 50 bucks right now
if you turn into a venus flytrap
switching engines

pretty much
locking in on coordinate grid
where is it

decloaking activated
is that it the core
in her notes she called it the tesseract
whoa
what was lawson doing with all this kid stuff

talos
he didnt come here for the tesseract

we didnt know what to do
marvell warned us not to send a signal for any reason

she led me to you
im so sorry
i didnt know
carol

they got in her head just like we thought
the supreme intelligence will set her straight

if you hurt them i will burn you to the ground
with what exactly
your power comes from us
you didnt give me these powers
the blast did
and yet youve never had the strength
to control them on your own
species flerken
threat high
its a cat not hannibal lecter
species human male
threat low to none
that things clearly busted
load the flerken onto the helion
eject the others into space
you did good ace
thanks to you
those insidious shapeshifters

thats not their defense system ronan
take her down
whoo
return to the jump point
well be back for the weapon
the core
the woman
im so proud of you
youve come a long way
since i found you that day by the lake
but can you keep your emotions in check
long enough to take me on
or will they get the better of you as always
i always told you
youll be ready
the day you can knock me down as yourself
this is that moment
this is that moment vers
turn off the light show
and prove to me you can beat me without
i have nothing to prove to you

i cant go back emptyhanded
you wont be emptyhanded
im sending you with a message

its just a scratch
no
i cant believe
you got in the raddest dogfight ever
and i missed it
id say you arrived just in time
some nifty flying you did out there
shield could always use a good pilot like you
ill consider it
as long as you never call my flying nifty again
hows your eye
hmm getting better every second
just so im clear
you were sohlarr
 and the shield agent  keller
he tied my boss up stole his identity
i borrowed his likeness im no thief
it is a little like stealing
whose side are you on here
youre good to go here until you recover
but you and your family are gonna need a new look
i could go back to being your boss
uh please dont

no way you guys have the best eyes

or maybe i could fly up and meet you halfway
ah only if you learn to glow like your auntie carol
or maybe ill build a spaceship
 you dont know  he doesnt
keep the tesseract on earth
hidden
you sure thats what marvel would want
marvell
thats what i said
its two words mar vell
marvell
marvel sounds a lot better
you know like the marvelettes
not ringing any bells
keep singing maybe itll come back to me
i upgraded it
range should be a couple galaxies at least
what you think im gonna crank call you
for emergencies only okay
well
if youre ever passing back through this galaxy
be sure to give a brother a shout
oh
we got the ketchup stain off
thanks lieutenant trouble
hmm
its hard for me to say goodbye too
go on
glad to have you back sir this came for you
so is it true
that the kree burned your eye out
because you refused to give them the tesseract
i will neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story
understood
im sorry to report
that we still havent found the tesseract
im sure itll turn up somewhere
ill let you know when it does
then what
sir
we have no idea
what other intergalactic threats are out there
and our onewoman security force
had a prior commitment
on the other side of the universe
shield alone cant protect us
we need to find more
more weapons
more heroes
you think you can find others like her
hmm we found her and we werent even looking
get some rest sir
you got a big decision to make
this is a nightmare
ive had better nightmares
hey
so that thing just stopped
doing whatever the hell it was doing
what do we got
whatever signal it was sending finally crapped out
i thought we bypassed the battery
we did
its still plugged in it just stopped
reboot it send the signal again
we dont even know what this is
fury did just do it please
you tell me the second you get a signal
i wanna know whos on the other end of that thing
wheres fury
theres a girl in this harbor town
and she works layin whiskey down
they say brandy fetch another round
and she serves them whiskey and wine
the sailors say brandy youre a fine girl
what a good wife you would be
 come on  slow down
this way my river lily come on
where are you taking me
come on come on
look look
oh its beautiful
i was afraid it wouldnt take to the soil
but it rooted quickly
and soon itll be everywhere
all across the universe
well i dont know what youre talking about
but i like the way you say it
my heart is yours
meredith quill
i cant believe i fell in love with a spaceman
showtime aholes
it will be here any minute
which will be its loss
i thought your thing was a sword
weve been hired to stop an interdimensional beast
from feeding on those batteries and im gonna stop it with a sword
its just swords were your thing and guns were mine
but i guess were both doing guns now i just didnt know that
drax why arent you wearing one of rockets aerorigs
it hurts
it hurts
i have sensitive nipples
my nipples hurt oh goodness me
what about him whats he doing
im finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work
how is that a priority
blame quill hes the one who loves music so much
no i actually agree with drax on this
thats hardly important right now
oh okay sure quill
no seriously i side with drax
no i understand that youre being very serious right now
i can clearly see you winking
damn it im using my left eye
i am groot
they were not looking at you funny
well thats intense
groot
groot get out of the way youre gonna get hurt
hi
no spit it out
come on
disgusting
the beasts hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside
i must cut through it from the inside
huh
no no drax wait a minute
drax
what is he doing
he said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside so he
 that doesnt make any sense  i tried telling him that
skin is the same level of thickness from the inside as from the outside
i realize that
there is a cut on its neck
rocket get it to look up
hey you giant seamonkey up here
watch it quill
yes i have singlehandedly
vanquished the beast
what
what are they called again
anulax batteries
harbulary batteries
thats nothing like what i just said
but theyre worth thousands of units apiece
which is why the sovereign hired us to protect them
careful what you say around these folks theyre easily offended
the cost of transgression is death
we thank you guardians for putting your lives on the line
we could not risk the lives of our own sovereign citizens
every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community
impeccable both physically and mentally
we control the dna of our progeny
germinating them in birthing pods
i guess i prefer to make people the oldfashioned way
perhaps someday you could give me a history lesson
in the archaic ways of our ancestors
for academic purposes
i would be honored yes
in the name of research
i think that could be pretty uh
repulsive
im not into that kind of casual
oh please
your people promised something in exchange for our services
bring it
and we shall gladly be on our way
family reunion yay
i understand she is your sister
shes worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on xandar
our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries
do with her as you please
we thank you high priestess ayesha
what is your heritage mr quill
my mother is from earth
and your father
he aint from missouri thats all i know
i see it within you
an unorthodox genealogy
a hybrid that seems particularly
reckless
you know they told me you people were conceited douchebags
but that isnt true at all
oh shit
im using my wrong eye again arent i
im sorry that was meant to be behind your back
count yourself blessed they didnt kill you
youre telling me
you wanna buy some batteries
all right lets get baldy to xandar
and collect that bounty
that stuff about my father
who does she think she is
i know youre sensitive about that
im not sensitive about it i just dont know who he is
sorry if it seemed like i was flirting with the high priestess
i wasnt
i dont care if you were
well i feel like you do care
thats why im apologizing so sorry
gamora is not the one for you quill
damn shadow
there are two types of beings in the universe
those who dance and those who do not
mmmhmm
i first met my beloved at a war rally
oh god
everyone in the village flailed about dancing
except one woman
my ovette
i knew immediately she was the one for me
the most melodic song in the world could be playing
she wouldnt even tap her foot
wouldnt move a muscle
one might assume she was dead
that does sound pretty hot
it would make my nether regions engorge
okay i get it yes
im a dancer gamora is not
you just need to find a woman who is pathetic like you
mmm
im hungry hand me some of that yaro root
no its not ripe yet
and i hate you
you hate me
you left me there while you stole that stone for yourself
and yet here you stand a hero
i will be free of these shackles soon enough and i will kill you
i swear
no
youre gonna live out the rest of your days
in a prison on xandar
wishing you could
this is weird
weve got a sovereign fleet approaching from the rear
why would they do that
probably because rocket stole some of their batteries
dude
right
he didnt steal some of those
i dont know why theyre after us what a mystery this is
what were you thinking
dude they were really easy to steal
 thats your defense  come on
you saw how that high priestess talked down to us
now im teaching her a lesson
oh i didnt realize your motivation was altruism
its really a shame the sovereign have mistaken your intentions
 and theyre trying to kill us  exactly
i was being sarcastic
oh no
youre supposed to use a sarcastic voice
now i look foolish
can we put the bickering on hold
until after we survive this massive space battle
 more incoming  good
i wanna kill some guys
youre not killing anyone
all those ships are remotely piloted
damn it
what is the delay admiral
high priestess the batteries they are exceptionally combustible
and could destroy the entire fleet
our concern is their slight against our people
we hired them and they steal from us
it is heresy of the highest order
all command modules
fire with the intent to kill
whats the nearest habitable planet
its called berhert
 how many jumps  only one
but the access point is 47 clicks away
and you have to go through that quantum asteroid field
quill to make it through that
youd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe
lucky for us i
i am
what are you doing
ive been flying this rig since i was 10 years old
i was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft
you were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag
stop it
later on tonight youre gonna be laying down in your bed
and theres gonna be something squishy in your pillow case
and youre gonna be like whats this
and its gonna be because i put a turd in there
you put your turd in my bed i shave you
oh it wont be my turd
it will be draxs
i have famously huge turds
were about to die and this is what were discussing
son of a
dude seriously
hey let me
idiots
well thats what you get
when quill flies
ow
we still have a sovereign craft behind us
our weapons are down
20 clicks to the jump
hold on
its not ripe
come on zylak you can do this
yes
15 clicks to the jump
come on
keep going
10 clicks
die spaceship
you suck zylak
typical
five clicks
son of a
they went around the field
someone destroyed all our ships
what
who
one click
 what is that  who cares
thats the jump point go
its a guy
oh my god
hes still out there
groot put your seatbelt on
prepare for a really bad landing
that was awesome
yes
look at this
where is the other half of our ship
my ship
either one of you could have gotten us through that field
had you flown with whats between your ears
instead of whats between your legs
if whats between my legs had a hand on it
i guarantee i could have landed this ship with it
peter we almost died because of your arrogance
more like because he stole
the anulax batteries
theyre called harbulary batteries
no theyre not
do you know why i did it starmunch hmm
im not gonna answer to starmunch
i did it because i wanted to
dick
what are we even talking about this for
we just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships
how little
well i dont know like this
a little oneinch man saved us
well if he got closer im sure he would be much larger
thats how eyesight works you stupid raccoon
dont call me a raccoon
im sorry i took it too far
i meant trash panda
is that better
i dont know
its worse its so much worse
you son of a
hey
 ive had it with you  no back up
someone followed you through the jump point
set me free youll need my help
im not a fool nebula
you are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat
youll attack me the moment i let you go
no i wont
youd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie
i bet its the oneinch man
after all these years ive found you
and who the hell are you
i figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious
my name is ego
and im your dad peter
you know what they say
youre out of luck until youve gone duck
yondu
come on down
after going around years in circles
with this woman i end up marrying
i said aleta i love you girl
but youre losing your mind
then again shes always been that way
i could never trust her you know
stakar
its been some time
it seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable
 sir  stakar
theres a hundred ravager factions
you lost the business of 99 of them by serving one
please sir please
get away from me
you can go to hell then
i dont give a damn what you think of me
so what are you following us for
because youre gonna listen to what i gotta say
i dont gotta listen to nothing
you betrayed the code
ravagers dont deal in kids
i told you before i didnt know what was going on
you didnt know because
you didnt want to know because it made you rich
i demand a seat at the table
i wear these flames same as you
you may dress like us
but youll never hear the horns of freedom when you die yondu
and the colors of ogord
will never flash over your grave
if you think
i take pleasure in exiling you
youre wrong
you broke all our hearts
ah pathetic
first quill betrays us
and yondu just lets him go scotfree
we followed him because he was the one
who wasnt afraid to do what needed to be done
seems hes goin soft
if hes so soft why are you whispering
you know im right kraglin
you best be very careful what you say about our captain
who the hell is that
yondu udonta
i have a proposition for you
i hired yondu to pick you up
when your mother passed away
but instead of returning you
yondu kept you
i have no clue as to why
well ill tell you why
because i was a skinny little kid
who could squeeze into places adults couldnt
it made it easier for thievin
well ive been trying to track you down ever since
i thought yondu was your father
what weve been together this whole time
and you thought yondu was my actual blood relative
you look exactly alike
ones blue
no hes not my father
yondu was the guy who abducted me
kicked the crap out of me so i could learn to fight
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me
 eat you  yeah
oh that son of a bitch
howd you locate us now
well even where i reside out past the edge of whats known
weve heard tell about the man they call starlord
what say we head out there right now
your associates are welcome even that trianglefaced monkey there
i promise you
its unlike any other place youve ever seen
and there
i can explain your very special heritage
finally get to be
the father ive always wanted to be
excuse me
ive gotta take a whiz
im not buying it
lets go take a walk
i am mantis
what are you doing
smiling
i hear it is the thing to do to make people like you
not if you do it like that
oh
i was raised alone on egos planet
i do not understand the intricacies of social interaction
can i pet your puppy it is adorable
yes
that is called a practical joke
i liked it very much
i just made it up
give me a break
after all this time
youre gonna show up and all of a sudden
 you wanna be my dad  i hear you
and by the way this could be a trap
the kree purists the ravagers
 they all want us dead  i know but
but what
what was that story you told me about zardu hasselfrau
who
he owned a magic boat
david hasselhoff
right
not a magic boat a talking car
why did he talk again
to help him fight crime and to be supportive
as a child you would carry his picture in your pocket
and you would tell all the other children
that he was your father but that he was out of town
shooting knight rider or touring with his band in germany
i told you that when i was drunk why are you bringing that up now
i love that story
i hate that story
its so sad
as a kid i used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad
and i wanted that more than anything in the world
thats my point peter
what if this man is your hasselhoff
if he ends up being evil
we will just kill him
youre leaving me with that fox
hes not a fox
shoot her if she does anything suspicious
 or if you feel like it  okay
itll be just a couple of days
well be back before rockets finished fixing the ship
what if the sovereign come
theres no way for them to know were here lets go
im uncertain about parting ways
god youre like an old woman
because im wise
why do you have so much luggage
i dont want groot playing with my things
i hope daddy isnt as big of a dick as you orphan boy
what is your goal here to get everybody to hate you
because its working
and if you dont love me now you will never love me again
i can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
and if you dont love me now
you will never love me again
i can still hear you saying
you would never break the chain
and if you dont love me now
you will never love me again
i can still hear you saying
you would never break the chain
hey can i ask you a personal question
oh
no one has ever asked me a personal question
your antennae what are they for
their purpose
yes quill and i have a bet
dude youre not supposed to say that
i say
if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low
your antennae will feel this and keep you from being decapitated
right and if its anything other than
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway i win
they are not for feeling doorways
i think
they have something to do with my empathic abilities
what are those
if i touch someone i can feel their feelings
 you read minds  no
telepaths know thoughts
empaths feel feelings
emotions
may i
all right
you feel love
yeah i guess i feel a general unselfish love for just about everybody
no
romantic sexual love
no i dont
 for her  no
okay
she just told everyone your deepest darkest secret
dude i think youre overreacting a little bit
you must be so embarrassed
do me do me
i have never felt such humor
so unbelievably uncool
oh quill
touch me and the only thing youre gonna feel is a broken jaw
i can also alter emotions to some extent
yeah like what
if i touch someone who is sad
i can ease them into contentment for a short while
i can make a stubborn person compliant
but i mostly use it to help my master sleep
he lies awake at night thinking about his progeny
do one of those on me
sleep
i love this song
huh
there
ah
aint so tough now without all your toys
are you
move
crap
hey there rat
hows it going you blue idiot
not so bad
we got ourselves a pretty good little gig here
this golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself
has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her
because she wants
to kill yall
your friend
theres too many of them
he needs my help if you care about him
you need to get me out of these bonds
they are going to kill him
i tell you it was pretty easy to find you
i put a tracer on your ship back there
during the war over xandar
give me your word you wont hurt groot
and ill tell you where the batteries are
lucky for you my word dont mean squat
otherwise id actually hand you over
otherwise youd what
well take them batteries
theyre worth what a quarter mill on the open market
that priestess offered us a million
a quarter is only one third of that
a quarter aint a third
a quarter is 25
no
we cant even buy a pair of boots with 25 units
enough
the point is we aint stupid enough to help kill the guardians of the galaxy
the whole dang nova corps would be on us
that aint right
i just gotta say it this one time captain
no matter how many times quill betrays you
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter
yeah
im the one what sticks up for you
take it easy kraglin
damn straight lad hes gone soft
suppose its time for a change in leadership
put your damn guns down
whoa whoa
there must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this fellas
or even a violent one where im standing over there
well hello boys
its not ripe
welcome everyone to my world
wow you have your own planet
come on no larger than your earths moon
humility
i like it
i too am extraordinarily humble
you own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit
what are you exactly
im whats called a celestial sweetheart
a celestial like a god
mmm small g son
at least on the days im feeling humble as drax
whoa
i dont know where i came from exactly
first thing i remember is flickering
adrift in the cosmos utterly
and entirely alone
over millions of years
i learned to control the molecules around me
i grew smarter and stronger
and i continued building from there
layer by layer
the very planet you walk on now
whoa
but i wanted more
i desired
meaning
there must be some life out there in the universe
besides just me i thought
and so i set myself the task of finding it
i created
what i imagined biological life to be like
down to the most minute detail
did you make a penis
dude
what is wrong with you
if he is a planet how could he make a baby with your mother
he would smush her
i dont need to hear how my parents
why
my father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother every winter solstice
thats disgusting
it was beautiful
you earthers have hangups
yes drax i got a penis
ha thank you
its not half bad
 oh  ugh
ive also got pain receptors and a digestive system
and all the accompanying junk
i wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human
as i set out amongst the stars
until i found
what i sought
life
i was not alone in the universe after all
when did you meet my mother
not long after
it was with meredith that i first experienced love
i called her my river lily
and from that love peter
you
i have searched for you for so long
and when i heard of a man from earth
who held an infinity stone in his hand without dying
i knew you must be the son of the woman i loved
if you loved her why did you leave her
this is mutiny
this is mutiny
youre scum
oh
captain
help me please
captain
youre the one what killed those men
by leading them down the wrong path
because youre weak
and stupid
its time for the ravagers
to rise once again to glory with a new captain
taserface
im sorry your name is
its taserface
thats right
do you shoot tasers out of your face
its metaphorical
yeah
for what
for it is a name what strikes fear
into the hearts of anyone what hears it
okay
okay
whatever you say
you shut up
youre next
udonta i have waited a long time to do
what
im sorry i am so sorry
i just keep imagining you waking up in the morning sir
looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself
you know what would be a really kickass name
taserface
thats how i hear you in my head
what was your second choice
scrotum hat
new plan were killing you first
well dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life
as a moronic shitbag who thinks taserface is a cool name
thats enough killing for today
shes the daughter of thanos
i thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy
that was when daddy was paying my bills
the priestess wants to kill the fox herself
and he has bounties on his head in at least 12 kree provinces
i assure you
i am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick
or a talking woodland beast
i want 10 of the take
and a couple more things
we got a whole box of hands
 if that one dont work out  it is fine
you think them kree is gonna execute the captain
the kree consider themselves merciful it will be painless
well here it is its the best ship we got
location of egos planet in the nav
well wire you the 10 once wes paid
what are you gonna do with your share
as a child my father would have gamora and me
battle one another in training
every time my sister prevailed
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery
claiming he wanted me to be her equal
but she won
again and again and again never once refraining
so after i murder my sister
i will buy a warship
with every conceivable instrument of death
i will hunt my father like a dog and i will tear him apart slowly
piece by piece
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain
i know every single day
yeah
i was talking about like a pretty necklace
or a nice hat
something to make the other girls go ooh thats nice
anyways happy trails
my mother told everyone my father was from the stars
she had brain cancer so everyone thought she was delusional
peter
listen id love to believe all of this i really would
but you left
the most wonderful woman ever
to die alone
i didnt want to leave your mother peter
if i dont return regularly to my planet
and the light within it
this form will wither and perish
so why didnt you come back why did you send yondu
a criminal of all people to come and fetch me
i loved your mother peter
i couldnt stand to set foot on an earth
where she wasnt living you cant imagine what thats like
i know exactly what that feels like
i had to watch her die
over the millions and millions of years of my existence
ive made many mistakes peter
but youre not one of them
please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be
theres so much that i need to teach you about this planet
and the light within
they are a part of you peter
what do you mean
give me your hands son
here
hold them like that
now close your eyes and concentrate
take your brain to the center of this planet
yes
whoa
yes its okay
just relax concentrate
you can do it bring it back
yes
yes now shape it
feel that energy
yes
youre home
peter
how did you get to this weird dumb planet
ego found me in my larva state
orphaned on my homeworld
he raised me by hand and kept me as his own
so youre a pet
i suppose
people usually want cute pets
why would ego want such a hideous one
i am hideous
you are horrifying to look at yes
but thats a good thing
oh
when youre ugly and someone loves you
you know they love you for who you are
beautiful people never know who to trust
well then im certainly grateful to be ugly
those pools they remind me of a time
when i took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld
she was like you
disgusting
innocent
drax
theres something i must tell you
whats going on
this gross bug lady is my new friend
im learning many things like im a pet and ugly
youre not ugly drax
what are you talking about
mantis
can you show us where well be staying
why are there no other beings on this planet
the planet is ego
a dog would not invite a flea to live on his back
and youre not a flea
im a flea with a purpose
i help him sleep
what were you about to say to drax before i walked out
nothing
your quarters are this way
we deliver you to the kree in the morning
neither one of you will last much longer after that
okay taserface
hey tell the other guys we said
hi taserface
what about this little plant can i smash it with a rock
no gef
its too adorable to kill
take it to the tailor
no offense but your employees are a bunch of jerks
i was a kree battle slave for 20 years when stakar freed me
he offered me a place with the ravagers
he said all i needed to do was adhere to the code
but i was young
and greedy and stupid
like you stealing those batteries
that was mostly drax
me and stakar and the other captains
we werent so different from you and your friends
the only family i ever had
when i broke the code
they exiled me
this is what i deserve
slow down drama queen
you might deserve this but i dont
we gotta get outta here
wheres quill
he went off with his old man
 ego  yeah
its a day for dumbass names
youre smiling and for a second i got a warm feeling
but then it was ruined by those disgustingass teeth
you like a professional asshole or what
pretty much a pro
why didnt you deliver quill to ego like you promised
he was skinny
could fit into places we couldnt good for thievin
uhhuh
i got an idea on how to get outta here
but were gonna need your little friend
mascot mascot mascot
little fellows all worked up he needs a drink
look how cute it is when its all riled up
hes goddang precious
psst
hey twig
come here
come on
aw man
what did they do to you
hey you wanna help us get outta here
theres something i need you to get and bring back to me
in the captains quarters theres a prototype fin
the thing i wore on my head
theres a drawer next to the bunk its in that its red
you got it
thats my underwears
yeah i was pretty sure he didnt know what you were talkin about
you have to explain it more careful
its a prototype fin
thats an orloni its a fin groot
you explain it this time
all right
thats vorkers eye
he takes it out when he sleeps
go look again
but leave the eye here
why
hes gonna wake up tomorrow
and hes not gonna know
where his eye is
thats a desk
we told you it was this big
tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere
with a bunch of severed human toes
okay then lets just agree to never discuss this
the drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it
okay
what no
he thinks you want him to wear it as a hat
thats not what i said
i am groot
hes relieved you dont want him to
 i am groot  he hates hats
i am groot
on anyone not just himself
i am groot
one minute you think someone has a weirdshaped head
the next minute its just because you realize part of that head is the hat
thats why you dont like hats
this is an important conversation right now
that aint it
i didnt mean to do a mutiny
they killed all my friends
get the third quadrant ready for release
one more thing
you got any clones of quills old music on the ship
ah
hes got it
yondus got the fin
go
down there
oh
you maniac
the whole ships gonna blow
not the whole ship
who is this
i am sending you the coordinates for yondus ship
 release the quadrant  aye captain
i only ask one thing
that your high priestess
tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate
taserface
where to captain
ego
no boy
it aint healthy for a mammalian body to hop more than 50 jumps at a time
i know that
we are about to do 700
so i guess this could all be mine someday
rocket rocket are you there
what are you doing peter
dance with me
im not going to dance with you
this is sam cooke
one of the greatest earth singers of all time
drax thinks youre not a dancer
if you ever tell anyone about this
i will kill you
when are we gonna do something about this unspoken thing between us
what unspoken thing
this
cheers sam and diane
a guy and a girl on a tv show who dig each other
but never say it because if they do
the ratings would go down
sort of thing
theres no unspoken thing
well its a catch22 because if you said it
then it would be spoken
and you would be a liar so by not saying it
you are telling the truth and admitting that there is
no thats not what i
what we should be discussing right now is something about this place
it doesnt feel right
what are you talking about
youre the one who wanted me to come here
that girl mantis
shes afraid of something
why are you trying to take this away from me
im not trying
hes my father hes blood
you have blood on earth and you never wanted to return there
again you made me come here
and earth is the place where my mother died in front of me
no its because that place is real and this is a fantasy
this is real im only half human remember
thats the half im worried about
oh i get it youre jealous
because im partgod and you like when im the weak one
you were insufferable to begin with
i havent been able to reach rocket
im gonna go outside and im gonna try and get a signal
you know what this is not cheers after all
this is whatever the show is where one person is willing
to open themselves up to new possibility
and the other person is a jerk
who doesnt trust anybody
its a show that doesnt exist
thats why it would get zero ratings
i dont know what cheers is
i finally found my family dont you understand that
i thought you already had
damn it
psychopath
are you kidding me
i win
i win i bested you in combat
no i saved your life
well you were stupid enough to let me live
you let me live
i dont need you always trying to beat me
im not the one that just flew across the universe
just because i wanted to win
do not tell me what i want
i dont need to tell you what you want
its obvious
you were the one who wanted to win and i just wanted a sister
you were all i had
but you were the one who needed to win
thanos pulled my eye from my head
and my brain from my skull
and my arm from my body
because of you
you all right son
i saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff
yeah
its fortuitous
you listening to this song
 you know  brandy
by looking glass
a favorite of your moms
yeah it was
one of earths greatest musical compositions
perhaps its very greatest
yes
peter you and i were the sailor in that song
he came on a summers day
bringing gifts from far away
like the child i put in your mother
or the freedom you brought gamora
brandy youre a fine girl
what a good wife you would be
my life my love
my lady is the sea
the sea calls the sailor back
he loves the girl but thats not his place
the sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men
and sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals
well you may not be mortal but me
no peter
death will remain a stranger to both of us
as long as the light burns within the planet
im immortal
mmmhmm
really
yes as long as the light exists
and i can use the light to build cool things
like how you made this whole planet
it might take you a few million years of practice
before you get really good at it but yes
what
get ready for an 800foot statue of pacman with skeletor
and heather locklear
you can do anything you want
im gonna make some weird shit
but you know peter it is a tremendous responsibility
only we can remake the universe
only we can take the bridle of the cosmos
and lead it to where it needs to go
how
come with me
drax drax drax
drax we need to talk
im sorry
but i like a woman with some meat on her bones
what
i tried to let you down easily by telling you i found you disgusting
no thats not what i
what are you doing
im imagining being with you physically
drax
i dont like you like that
i dont even like the type of thing you are
hey theres no need to get personal
listen egos gotten exactly what he wanted
i should have told you earlier
im stupid you are in danger
what is that
now you need to readjust the way you process life
everything around us including the girl
everything is temporary
we are forever
doesnt eternity get boring
not if you have a purpose peter
which is why youre here
i told you how all those years ago
i had an unceasing impulse to find life
but what i did not tell you was how when i finally did find it
it was all so
disappointing
and that is when i came
to a profound realization
my innate desire to seek out other life
was not so that i could walk among that life
peter
i have found meaning
i see it
eternity
oh my god
we need to get off this planet
oh man
anyway before i was so rudely interrupted
at that time i was a federal express man
what the hell you doing boy
i could tell by how you talked about him
this ego is bad news
were here to save quill
for what huh for honor for love
no i dont care about those things
i wanna save quill so i can prove im better than him
i can lord this over him forever
what are you laughing at me for
you can fool yourself and everyone else but you cant fool me
i know who you are
you dont know anything about me loser
i know everything about you
i know you play like youre the meanest and the hardest
but actually youre the most scared of all
shut up
i know you steal batteries you dont need
and you push away anyone whos willing to put up with you
because just a little bit of love
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is
i said shut up
i know them scientists what made you never gave a rats ass about you
im serious dude
just like my own damn parents who sold me
their own little baby into slavery
i know who you are boy
because youre me
what kind of a pair are we
the kind thats about to go fight a planet i reckon
all right okay good wait
fight a what
who are you people
what is this place
gamora let her go
the bodies in the caverns who are they
you are scared
i call it the expansion
it is my purpose
and now it is yours as well
its beautiful
over thousands of years
i implanted thousands of extensions of myself
on thousands of worlds
i need to fulfill lifes one true purpose
to grow and spread
covering all that exists
until everything is
me
what did she do to me
she already told me everything
i only had one problem
a single celestial doesnt have enough power
for such an enterprise
but two celestials
well now that just might do
the bodies
are his children
out of all my labors
the most beguiling was
attempting to graft my dna with that of another species
i hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough
to power the expansion
i had yondu deliver some of them to me
it broke the ravager code but i compensated him generously
and to ease his conscience i said id never hurt them
i mean that was true they never felt a thing
but one after the other they failed me
not one of them carried the celestial genes
until you peter
out of all my spawn
only you carried the connection to the light
we need to find peter now and get off this damn planet
ego will have won him to his side by now
 then we just go  no
 hes our friend  all any of you do
is yell at each other you are not friends
youre right
were family
we leave no one behind
except maybe you
oh my god
for the first time in my existence
i am truly not alone
what is it son
my friends
you see thats the mortal in you peter
yes
we are beyond such things
yes
 now  but my mother
you said you loved my mother
and that i did
my river lily who knew all the words to every song that came over the radio
i returned to earth to see her three times
and i knew if i returned a fourth
id never leave
the expansion
the reason for my very existence would be over
so i did what i had to do
but it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head
what
now all right
i know that sounds bad
who in the hell do you think you are
you killed my mother
i tried
so hard
to find the form
that best suited you
and this is the thanks i get
you really need to grow up
i wanted to do this together
but i suppose youll have to learn
by spending the next thousand years as a battery
finally rocket
keep that transmitter nearby so i can find you
were in an old piece of construction equipment yondu once used
to slice open the bank of a askavaria
egos unhinged
i know get ready
drop her kraglin
no
my life my love
my lady is the sea
peter
this is the sea
oh
hey there jackass
what is that thing
out of the way dumber smaller groot
i told you something didnt feel right
i told you so just what i need to hear right now
well i came back didnt i
because theres an unspoken thing
there is no unspoken thing
what are you doing you couldve killed us all
uh thank you rocket
we had it under control
we did not that is only an extension
of his true self he will be back soon
whats smurfette doing here
whatever i need to do to get a damn ride home
she tried to murder me
i saved you you stupid fox
hes not a fox
 i am groot  im not a raboon either
i am groot
raccoon whatever
how do we kill a celestial
theres a center to him
his brain his soul whatever it is
some sort of protective shell
its in the caverns
below the surface
yondu
thrusters are out
guess i should be glad i was a skinny kid
otherwise youd have delivered me to this maniac
you still reckon thats the reason
i kept you around you idiot
thats what you told me you old doofus
once i figured out what happened to them other kids
i wasnt just gonna hand you over
you said you were gonna eat me
that was being funny
not to me
you people have issues
of course i have issues
thats my freakin father
thrusters are back up
 we should be going up  we cant
ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it
we have to kill him
rocket
got it
whoohoo
so were saving the galaxy again
i guess
awesome
were really gonna be able to jack up our prices
if were twotime galaxy savers
i seriously cant believe thats where your mind goes
it was just a random thought man i thought we were friends
of course i care about the planets and the buildings
and all the animals on the planets
and the people
meh
the crabby puppy is so cute he makes me wanna die
pilots
release envoy units
our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet
dive
um captain
captain
tell me why ego wants you here
he needs my genetic connection to the light
to help destroy the universe
he tried to teach me how to control the power
so could you
a little
i made a ball
a ball
i thought as hard as i could
it was all that i could come up with
you thought
you think when i make this arrow fly
i use my head
whoa
there
thats egos core
that ore is thick rocket
i got it covered
we must hurry
it will not take ego long to find us
keep it steady
we drill into the center we kill him
captain
what is it kraglin
hey remember that ayesha chick
 yeah why  uh
oh hell
why arent you firing the lasers
they blew out the generator
i think i packed a small detonator
a detonator is worthless without explosives
well we got these
is that thing strong enough to kill ego
if it is itll cause a chain reaction
throughout his entire nervous system
meaning what
the entire planet will explode
well have to get out of here fast
i rigged a timer
go
hes coming
didnt you say you could make him sleep
when he wants hes too powerful
i cant
you dont have to believe in yourself
because i believe in you
sleep
i never thought shed be able to do it
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be
i dont know how long i can hold him
the metals too thick
for the bomb to work wed actually need to place it on egos core
and our fat butts aint gonna fit through those tiny holes
well
thats a terrible idea
which is the only kind of idea we have left
unbelievable
rocket do this rocket do that
what a day
all right first you flick this switch then this switch
that activates it
then you push this button
which will give you five minutes to get out of there
now whatever you do
dont push this button
because that will set off the bomb immediately
and well all be dead
now repeat back what i just said
 i am groot  uhhuh
 i am groot  thats right
 i am groot  no
no thats the button that will kill everyone
try again
hmm
 i am groot  mmmhmm
 i am groot  uhhuh
i am groot
no thats exactly what you just said
how is that even possible
which button is the button youre supposed to push
point to it
no
hey youre making him nervous
shut up and get me some tape
does anybody have any tape out there
i wanna put some tape over the death button
i dont have any tape let me check
yo yondu ow
do you have any tape
gamora do you have any tape
tape
never mind ow
drax do you have any tape
yes scotch tape would work
then why did you ask me if scotch tape would work
if you dont have any
nobody has any tape
not a single person has tape
nope
did you ask nebula
yes
are you sure
i asked yondu
 and she was sitting next to him  i knew you were lying
you have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag
if anybodys gonna have tape its you
thats exactly my point i have to do everything
you are wasting a lot of time here
whee
were all gonna die
rear thrusters are out again
were done for without that generator
guardians
perhaps it will provide you solace
that your deaths are not without purpose
they will serve as a warning
to all of those tempted with betraying us
dont screw with the sovereign
this is gonna hurt
promises promises
hey
no
no no no
were gonna blow
peter no
what
you look like mary poppins
is he cool
hell yeah hes cool
im mary poppins yall
mantis look out
shes just unconscious
how long until the bomb goes off
in the unlikely event that groot doesnt kill us all
about six minutes
kraglin we need the quadrant for an extraction
tminus five minutes
aye captain
somebodys gotta be up top when kraglin arrives
drax take mantis
ow my nipples
gamora
peter
get over it
come now peter i know this isnt what you want
what kind of father would i be to let you make this choice
yeah
soon peter we will be all there is
so stop pissing me off
we have to get up to the extraction point
go
i told you
i dont want to do this alone
you cannot deny
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you
everyone i need you to stay back
what is that
it doesnt need to be like this peter
why are you destroying our chance
stop pretending you arent what you are
one in billions
trillions even more
what greater meaning can life possibly have to offer
i dont use my head to fly the arrow boy
i use my heart
you shouldnt have killed my mom and squished my walkman
and if you dont love me now
you will never love me again
i can still hear you saying
you would never break the chain
and if you dont love me now
you will never love me again
i can still hear you saying
you would never break the chain
and if you dont love me now
you will never love me again
i can still hear you saying
you would never break the chain
groot if you can hear me hurry up
im not sure how long quill can keep him distracted
groot hurry
yondu were about to blow
get to the ship
not without quill
you need to take care of the twig
not without you
i aint done nothin right my whole damn life rat

yondu what are you doing
you cant
yondu
no
no
oh aww
no no
oh no
i told gamora
how when i was a kid i used to pretend
david hasselhoff was my dad
hes a singer and actor from earth really famous guy
earlier it struck me
yondu didnt have a talking car but he did have a flying arrow
he didnt have the beautiful voice of an angel
but he did have the whistle of one
both yondu and david hasselhoff went on kickass adventures
and hooked up with hot women
and fought robots
i guess david hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all
only it was you yondu
i had a pretty cool dad
what im trying to say here is
sometimes that thing youre searching for your whole life
its right there by your side all along
you dont even know it
i am groot
he did call you twig
nebula
i was a child like you
i was concerned with staying alive until the next day every day
and i never considered what thanos was doing to you
im trying to make it right
there are little girls like you
across the universe who are in danger
you can stay with us and help them
i will help them by killing thanos
i dont know if thats possible
you will always be my sister
pete
captain found this for you in a junker shop
said youd come back to the fold someday
what is it
its called a zune
its what everybodys listening to on earth nowadays
its got 300 songs on it
300 songs
wait
rocket grabbed the pieces and reassembled them
i think yondu would want you to have it
thanks
captain
its not time to make a change
just relax take it easy
youre still young thats your fault
theres so much you have to know
find a girl settle down
if you want you can marry
look at me i am old but im happy

i sent word to yondus old ravager buddies
and told them what he did

its just
some unspoken thing
its beautiful
it is
and so are you
on the inside
now theres a way
and i know that i have to go away

my government knows no shame
you xandarians and your culture are a disease
you
will never rule xandar
no
i will cure it
ronan
korath has returned
master he is a thief
an outlaw who calls himself starlord
but we have discovered he has an agreement
to retrieve the orb for an intermediary known
as the broker
i promised thanos i would retrieve the orb for him
only then will he destroy xandar for me
nebula go to xandar and get me the orb
it will be my honor
it will be your doom
if this happens again youll be facing our father
without his prize
im a daughter of thanos
just like you
but i know xandar
ronan has already decreed that i
do not speak for me
you will not fail
have i ever
xandarians
what a bunch of losers
all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid
to nothing at all pathetic

an occupational hazard im sure in your line of work
some machineheaded freak working for a dude named ronan
ronan im sorry mr quill
i truly am
but i want no part of this transaction if ronan is involved
whos ronan
a kree fanatic outraged by the peace treaty
who will not rest until xandarian culture my culture
 is wiped from existence  come on
hes someone whose bad side id rather not be on
 what what about my bad side  farewell mr quill
hey we had a deal bro

yeah stay out of the way
come on man its a its an outlaw name
just relax pal
its cool to have a code name its not that weird
fascists
ronan is destroying xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy
i should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the kree
we signed your peace treaty nova prime what more do you want
at least a statement from the kree empire saying that they condemn his actions
he is slaughtering children families
that is your business now i have other matters to attend to
prick
well some good news
it looks like weve apprehended one of ronans compatriots
gamora surgically modified and trained as a living weapon
the adopted daughter of the mad titan thanos
recently thanos lent her and her sister nebula out to ronan
which leads us to believe that thanos and ronan are working together
subject 89p13 calls itself rocket
the result of illegal genetic
and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form
what the hell
they call it groot
a humanoid plant thats been travelling recently
as 89p13s personal houseplantlmuscle
peter jason quill from terra
raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the ravagers
led by yondu udonta
im sorry
i didnt know how this machine worked
what a bunch of aholes
transport all four to the kyln
i guess most of nova corps wanna uphold the laws
but these ones here theyre corrupt and cruel
but hey thats not my problem i aint gonna be here long
ive escaped 22 prisons this ones no different
youre lucky the broad showed up because otherwise me and groot
would be collecting that bounty right now
and youd be getting drawn and quartered by yondu and those ravagers
ive had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years
i aint about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon
hold
 whats a raccoon  whats a raccoon
its what you are stupid
aint no thing like me except me
so this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase
ark of the covenant maltese falcon sort of vibe
 what is it  i am groot
so what whats the orb

pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac
yeah i know who you are
 anyone whos anyone knows who you are  yeah we know who you are
 who is she  i am groot
yeah you said that
i wasnt retrieving the orb for ronan i was betraying him
i had an agreement to sell it to a third party
i am groot
well thats just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told me that
what is wrong with giving tree here
well he dont know talking good like me and you
so his vocabulistics is limited to i and am and groot
exclusively in that order
i tell you what thats gonna wear real thin real fast
hey put that away
hey
listen to me you big blue bastard take those headphones off
thats mine those belong to impound that tape and that player is mine
hooked on a feeling blue swede 1973 that song belongs to me
 you first you first  murderer
coming for you first gamora youre dead
youre scum youre scum
its like i said
shes got a rep
a lot of prisoners here have lost their families
to ronan and his goons
shell last a day tops
murderer
the guards will protect her right
theyre here to stop us from getting out
they dont care what we do to each other inside
whatever nightmares the future holds
are dreams compared to whats behind me
check out the new meat
im gonna slather you up in gunavian jelly
and go to town
lets make something clear
this one here is our booty
you wanna get to him
you go through us
or more accurately
we go through you
im with them
i hate you
no cells gonna protect you for long
youre dead
dead
take her down to the showers
itll be easier to clean up the blood down there
quill where you going
quill
quill
gamora consider this a death sentence
for your crimes against the galaxy
you dare
you know who i am yes
youre drax
the destroyer
quill
and you know why they call me this
you slayed dozens of ronans minions
ronan murdered my wife ovette
and my daughter camaria
he slaughtered them where they stood
and he laughed
quill
her life
is not yours to take
he killed my family
i shall kill one of his in return
of course drax here i
quill what are you doing
im no family to ronan or thanos
im your only hope at stopping him
woman your words mean nothing to me
 hey hey hey hey hey  crap
you know if killing ronan is truly your sole purpose
i dont think this is the best way to go about it
are you not the man this wench attempted to kill
well i mean shes hardly the first woman to try and do that to me
look this is from a smokinghot rajak girl
stabbed me with a fork didnt like me skipping out on her at sunrise
i got right here a kree girl tried to rip out my thorax
she caught me with this skinny little aaskavariian who worked in nova records
i was trying to get information you ever see an aaskavariian
they have tentacles and needles for teeth
if you think im seriously interested in that then
you dont care but heres the point
she betrayed ronan hes coming back for her
and when he does
thats when you
why would i put my finger on his throat
what
no its a symbol
this is a symbol for you slicing his throat
i would not slice his throat
i would cut his head clean off
its a general expression for you killing somebody
youve heard of this youve seen this right
 you know what that is  yeah yeah
 everyone knows  no no
what im saying is you want to keep her alive
dont do his work for him
i like your knife im keeping it
 that was my favorite knife  listen
i could care less whether you live or whether you die
 then why stop the big guy  simple
you know where to sell my orb
how are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here
my friend rocket here
has escaped 22 prisons
were getting out
and then were headed straight to yondu to retrieve your bounty
how much was your buyer willing to pay you for my orb
four billion units
 what  holy shit
that orb is my opportunity to get away from thanos and ronan
if you free us
ill lead you to the buyer directly and ill split the profit between the three of us
i am groot
four of us
asleep for the danger awake for the money as per frickin usual
you have been betrayed ronan
we know only that she has been captured
gamora may yet recover the orb
no our sources within the kyln say gamora has her own plans for the orb
look your partnership with thanos
is at risk
thanos requires your presence now
with all due respect thanos your daughter made this mess
and yet you summon me
i would lower my voice accuser
first she lost a battle with some primitive
thanos put gamora under your charge
then she was apprehended by the nova corps
you are the one here with nothing to show for it
your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time
lower your tone
i may be your
i only ask that you take this matter seriously
the only matter i do not take seriously boy
is you
your politics bore me
your demeanor is that of a pouty child
and apparently you alienated my favorite daughter gamora
i shall honor our agreement kree
if you bring me the orb
but return to me again emptyhanded
and i will bathe the starways in your blood
thanks dad sounds fair
this is one fight you wont win
lets head to the kyln
if were gonna get out of here were gonna need to get into that watchtower
and to do that im gonna need a few things
the guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs i need one
leave it to me
that dude there i need his prosthetic leg
 his leg  yeah
god knows i dont need the rest of him look at him hes useless
all right
and finally on the wall back there is a black panel blinky yellow light
 do you see it  yeah
theres a quarnyx battery behind it purplish box green wires
to get into that watchtower i definitely need it
how are we supposed to do that
well supposably these baldbodies find you attractive
so maybe you can work out some sort of trade
you must be joking
no i really heard they find you attractive
look its 20 feet up in the air
and its in the middle of the most heavilyguarded part of the prison
its impossible to get up there without being seen
i got one plan and that plan requires a frickin quarnyx battery
so figure it out
can i get back to it thanks
now this is important once the battery is removed
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode
once we have it we gotta move quickly so you definitely need to get that last
or we could just get it first and improvise
 ill get the armband  leg
prisoner drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell
or we will open fire
i am
groot
fire
all prisoners return to your sleeping areas
you idiot
how am i supposed to fight these things without my stuff
the animal is in control
fire on my command
creepy little beast
oh yeah
you need my what
 ill need this  good luck
its internally wired
ill figure something out
drop the leg
drop the leg and move back to your cell
rocket
move to the watchtower
you
man who has lain with an aaskavariian
it was one time man
we need all available guards in full combat gear
spare me your foul gaze woman
why is this one here
we promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss
i always keep my promises when theyre to musclebound whackjobs
who will kill me if i dont here you go
i was just kidding about the leg i just need these two things
 what  no i thought itd be funny
was it funny wait what did he look like hopping around
i had to transfer him 30000 units
how are we going to leave
well hes got a plan right or is that another thing you made up
i have a plan i have a plan
cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement
yeah ill have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one
do not ever call me a thesaurus
its just a metaphor dude
his people are completely literal metaphors are gonna go over his head
nothing goes over my head
my reflexes are too fast i would catch it
im gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy
those are some big guns
on my command
number one
 rodent we are ready for your plan  hold on
number two
i recognize this animal wed roast them over a flame pit as children
 their flesh was quite delicious  not helping
number three
all fire on my command
three
two
one
he turned off the artificial gravity
everywhere but in here
i told you i had a plan
that was a pretty good plan
yeah there it is get my ship
its the milano the orange and blue one over in the corner
they crumpled my pants up into a ball
thats rude they folded yours
the orbs there lets go
 wait wait wait  what
that bastard didnt put it back
 put what back  here
get them to the ship i will be right back
 how are you gonna possibly  just keep the milano close by
go

well hows he gonna get to us
he declined to share that information with me
well screw this then
i aint waiting around for some humie with a death wish you got the orb right
yes
if we dont leave now we will be blown to bits
no
were not leaving without the orb
behold
this one shows spirit
he shall make a keen ally in the battle against ronan
companion what were you retrieving
youre an imbecile
yo ranger rick what are you doing
you cant take apart my ship without asking me
 see what is this  dont touch that
its a bomb
 a bomb  yup
and you leave it lying around
i was gonna put it in a box
whats a box gonna do
 how about this one  no hey
 leave it alone  why what is it
 shut up  hey
what is that
thats for if things get really hardcore
or if you wanna blow up moons
no ones blowing up moons
you just wanna suck the joy out of everything
so listen im gonna need your buyers coordinates
were heading in the right direction for now
if were gonna work together you might try trusting me a little bit
and how much do you trust me
id trust you a lot more if you told me what this was
because im guessing its some kind of weapon
i dont know what it is
if its a weapon we should use it against ronan
put it down you fool youll destroy us all
or just you murderess
i let you live once princess
 i am not a princess  hey
nobody is killing anybody on my ship
were stuck together until we get the money
i have no interest in money
great
that means more money for the three of us
for the four of us partners
we have an agreement but i would never be partners with the likes of you
ill tell the buyer were on our way
and quill your ship is filthy
she has no idea
if i had a black light
the place would look like a jackson pollock painting
you got issues quill
i swear i dont know where they went i swear
if he knew where they were headed he would have already told us
yeah
ronan the nova corps sent a fleet to defend the prison
well then send necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant
find the orb any means any price
 and this place  the nova cant know what were after
cleanse it
do you got any other cute little buggers like this one
i like to stick em all in a row on my control console
i cant tell if youre joking or not
hes being fully serious
in that case i can show you
but first you gonna tell me what this orb is
and why everybody cares so damn much about it
and then you gonna tell me
who out there might wanna buy it
sir the highend community is a
the highend community is a
its a tightknit
tightknit
the highend community is a very tightknit
i cannot possibly betray
the confidentiality of my buyers
now who again is this buyer of yours
carina
yes master
your people do have elbows do they not
we do master
then use them
i dont have to remind you
what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me
do i
chop chop our guests will be here soon
heads up were inbound
what is it
its called knowhere
the severed head of an ancient celestial being
be wary headed in rodent
there are no regulations whatsoever here
hundreds of years ago the tivan group sent workers in
to mine the organic matter within the skull
bone brain tissue spinal fluid
all rare resources highly valued in black markets across the galaxy
its dangerous and illegal work suitable only for outlaws
well i come from a planet of outlaws
billy the kid bonnie and clyde john stamos
it sounds like a place which i would like to visit
yeah you should
excuse me
 watch your wallets  can you spare any units
get out of here
your buyers in there
we are to wait here for his representative
get out of here
this is no respectable establishment
what do you expect us to do while we wait
yes yes
yahoo
my orloni has won
as i won at all things
now lets put more of this liquid into our bodies
thats the first thing you said that wasnt batshit crazy
man you wouldnt believe what they charge for fuel out here
 i might actually lose money on this job  my connection is making us wait
its just a negotiation tactic trust me this is my specialty
where yours is more stab stab those are my terms
 my father didnt stress diplomacy  thanos
hes not my father
when thanos took my home world he killed my parents in front of me
he tortured me turned me into a weapon
when he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for ronan
i couldnt stand by and
why would you risk your life for this
my mother gave it to me
my mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up
i happened to have it on me
when i was
the day that she
you know when i left earth
what do you do with it
do nothing you listen to it or you can dance
im a warrior and an assassin i do not dance
really
on my planet theres a legend about people like you
its called
footloose
and in it a great hero
named kevin bacon
teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing well
its the greatest thing there is
who put the sticks up their butts
what no thats just a
 that is cruel  its just a phrase
people use
the melody is pleasant
 no  what the hell
i know who you are peter quill
and i am not some starryeyed waif here to succumb to your
your pelvic sorcery
that is not what is happening here
no
stop it
what are you doing
this vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about
 that is true  he has no respect
 that is also true  hold on hold on
keep calling me vermin tough guy
you just wanna laugh at me like everyone else
rocket youre drunk all right no ones laughing at you
he thinks im some stupid thing he does
well i didnt ask to get made
i didnt ask to be torn apart
and put back together over and over
and turned into some
some little monster
rocket no ones calling you a monster
he called me vermin
she called me rodent
lets see if you can laugh
after five or six good shots to your frickin face
no no no no four billion units rocket
come on man hey suck it up for one more lousy night and youre rich
fine but i cant promise
when all this is over im not gonna kill every last one of you jerks
see thats exactly why none of you have any friends
five seconds after you meet somebody youre already trying to kill them
we have travelled halfway across the quadrant
and ronan is no closer to being dead
 drax  let him go
we dont need him
milady gamora
im here to fetch you for my master
okay this isnt creepy at all
we house the galaxys largest collection
of fauna relics and species of all manner
i present to you
taneleer tivan the collector
oh my dear gamora
how wonderful to meet in the flesh
lets bypass the formalities tivan
we have what we discussed
what is that thing there
i am groot
i never thought id meet a groot
sir
you must allow me to pay you now so that i may own your carcass
at the moment of your death of course
i am groot
why so he could turn you into a frickin chair
thats your pet
 his what  tivan
we have been halfway around the galaxy retrieving this orb
very well then
let us see what you brought
three quarnyx batteries seven cases of cotati seeds
no cases last time you sent me
you shall send a message for me
oh my new friends
before creation itself
there were six singularities
then the universe exploded into existence
and the remnants of these systems
were forged into concentrated ingots
infinity stones
these stones it seems
can only be brandished
by beings of extraordinary strength
observe
these carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations
like wheat in a field
theres a little pee coming out of me right now
once for a moment
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves
but even they were quickly destroyed by it
beautiful
beyond compare
were all very fascinated whitey but wed like to get paid
how would you like to get paid
what do you think fancy man units
very well then
carina
stand back
i will no longer be your slave
no
what the
how could i think tivan could contain whatever was within the orb
 what do you still have it for  what are we gonna do leave it in there
 i cant believe you had that in your purse  its not a purse its a knapsack
we have to bring this to the nova corps theres a chance they can contain it
are you kidding me were wanted by the nova corps
 just give it to ronan  so he can destroy the galaxy
what are you some saint all of a sudden
what has the galaxy ever done for you why would you wanna save it
because im one of the idiots who lives in it
peter listen to me we cannot allow the stone to fall into ronans hands
we have to go back to your ship and deliver it to nova
right right okay i think youre right
or we could give it to somebody whos not going to arrest us
whos really nice for a whole lot of money
i think its a really good balance between both of your points of view
youre despicable dishonorable
faithless
 no  at last
i shall meet my foe and destroy him
you called ronan
quill dont you move boy
dont you move get out of the way
ronan the accuser
you are the one who transmitted the message
you killed my wife
you killed my daughter
i told you you cant fit now wait here ill be back
it is gamora she is escaping with the orb
no
nebula
retrieve the orb
the stone is in the furthest pod
bring it down
rocket keep them off gamora until she gets to the milano
how weve got no weaponry on these things
these pods are industrial grade
theyre nearly indestructible
not against necroblasts theyre not
thats not what im saying
let me borrow your ride
i dont recall killing your family
i doubt ill remember killing you either
quill im trapped i cant make it to the milano
i have to head out
wait these things arent meant to go out there
you are a disappointment sister
of all our siblings
i hated you least
nebula please
if ronan gets this stone
 hell kill us all  not all
you will already be dead
ronan it is done
quill come on
her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes
but theres nothing we can do for her
these pods arent meant to be out here
in a second were gonna be in the same boat
damn it
quill
yondu yondu

youll die in seconds
quill

i saw you out there
i dont know what came over me
but i couldnt let you die
i found something inside of myself
something
incredibly heroic
i mean not to brag
but objectively
wheres the orb
its well they got the orb
what
welcome home peter
blasted idiot theyre all idiots
quill just got himself captured
none of this ever would have happened if you didnt try to singlehandedly
take on a frickin army
youre right
i was a fool
all the anger
all the rage
was just to cover my loss
my wife and child are dead
i dont care if its mean
everybodys got dead people
its no excuse to get everybody else
dead along the way
come on groot ronan has the stone
the only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe
as fast as we can and maybe
just maybe well be able to live full lives before that whackjob ever gets there
i am groot
save them how
i am groot
i know theyre the only friends that we ever had
but theres an army of ravagers around them
and theres only two of us
three
youre making me
beat up
grass
the orb is in my possession
as i promised
bring it to me
yes that was our agreement
bring you the orb
and you will destroy xandar for me
however now that i know it contains an infinity stone
i wonder what use i have for you
boy
i would reconsider your current course
master you cannot
thanos is the most powerful being in the universe
not anymore
you call me boy
i will unfurl 1000 years of kree justice on xandar
and burn it to its core
then thanos
i am coming for you
after xandar you are going to kill my father
you dare to oppose me
you see what he has turned me into
if you kill him i will help you destroy a thousand planets
you betray me
steal my money
stop it leave him alone
when i picked you up as a kid
these boys wanted to eat you
they aint never tasted terran before
i saved your life
will you shut up about that god
twenty years you been throwing that in my face
like its some great thing not eating me
normal people dont even think about eating someone else
much less that person having to be grateful for it
you abducted me man
you stole me from my home and from my family
you dont give a damn about your terra
youre scared
because youre soft in here
here right here
yondu
listen to me
ronan has something called an infinity stone
i know what hes got girl
then you know we must get it back
hes gonna use it to wipe out xandar
we have to warn them billions of people will perish
is that what shes been filling your head with boy
sentiment
eating away your brain like maggots
thats it
no
sorry boy
but a captains gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him
captains gotta teach stuff
if you kill me now
you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen
the stone
i hope you got something better than that
because aint nobody stealing from ronan
we got a ringer
is that right
she knows everything there is to know about ronan
his ships
his army
hes vulnerable
hey what do you say yondu
me and you taking down a mark sidebyside like the old days
let him go
you always did have a scrote boy
thats why i kept you on as a youngun
captain the shot was nondamaging
attention idiots
the lunatic on top of this craft is holding a hadron enforcer
its a weapon of my own design
what the hell
if you dont hand over our companions now
hes gonna tear your ship a new one
a very big new one
 i aint buyin it  im giving you to the count of five
 5 4 3  no wait hold on
rocket its me for god sakes
we figured it out were fine
hey quill whats going on
you call that figured it out
were gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless
you want to talk about senseless
how about trying to save us by blowing us up
we were only gonna blow you up if they didnt turn you over
and how on earth were they gonna turn us over
when you only gave them a count of five
we didnt have time to work out the minutiae of the plan
this is what we get for acting altruistically
 i am groot  they are ungrateful
whats important now is we get the ravagers army to help us save xandar
so we can give the stone to yondu whos just gonna sell to somebody even worse
 well figure that part out later  we have to stop ronan
how
 i have a plan  youve got a plan
yes
first of all youre copying me from when i said i had a plan
no im not people say that all the time its not that unique of a thing to say
secondly i dont even believe you have a plan
i have part of a plan
what percentage of a plan do you have
you dont get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on knowhere
i just saved quill
weve already established that you destroying the ship that im on is not saving me
 when did we establish it  like three seconds ago
i wasnt listening i was thinking of something else
shes right you dont get an opinion what percentage
 i dont know twelve percent  twelve percent
thats a fake laugh
 its real  totally fake
that is the most real authentic hysterical laugh of my entire life
 because that is not a plan  its barely a concept
 youre taking their side  i am groot
so what its better than 11 what the hell does that have to do with anything
thank you groot thank you
see groots the only one of you who has a clue
guys
come on
yondu is gonna be here in two seconds
he expects to hear this big plan of ours
i need your help
i look around at us
you know what i see
losers
i mean like
folks who have lost stuff
and we have man we have all of us
our homes
our families
normal lives
and usually life takes more than it gives but not today
today its given us something
it has given us a chance
to do what
to give a shit
for once
not run away
i for one am not gonna stand by and watch
as ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives
but quill stopping ronan
its impossible
youre asking us to die
yeah i guess i am
quill
i have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies
i will be grateful to die among my friends
you are an honorable man quill
i will fight beside you
and in the end
i will see my wife and daughter again
i am groot
what the hell i dont got that long a lifespan anyway
now im standing yall happy
were all standing up now
bunch of jackasses standing in a circle
the stone reacts to anything organic
the bigger the target the bigger the power surge
all ronans got to do is touch the stone to the planets surface and zap
all plants animals
 nova corps  everything will die
so ronan does not make the surface
rocket will lead a team to blow a hole
in the dark asters starboard hull
then our craft and yondus will enter
wont there be hundreds of sakaaran soldiers inside
i think of sakaaran as paper people
once they know were on board
ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck
which i can disable by dismantling the power source
well make it to the flight deck
and ill use the hadron enforcer to kill ronan
once ronan is dead we will retrieve the stone
use these devices to contain it
if you touch it
it will kill you
ill contact one of the nova officers who arrested us
hopefully theyll believe were there to help
theres one more thing we need to complete the plan
that guys eye
no no we dont no we dont need
that guys eye
no seriously i need it its important to me
ronans fleet has been spotted and will arrive in tminus
fifteen minutes
remember boy
at the end of all this
i get the stone
you cross me we kill you all
lets go get em boys
this is a terrible plan
hey youre the one who said you wanted to die among friends
nova prime
i received a transmission
from one of the ravagers
he says ronans in possession of something called an infinity stone
and hes headed toward xandar
good god
its a trick hes a criminal
did he say why we should believe him
he said his crew just escaped from prison
so hed have no other reason to risk coming to xandar to help
he says that hes an
ahole
but hes not
and im quoting him here
100 a dick
do you believe him
i dont know that i believe anyone is 100 a dick maam
i mean do you believe that he is here to help
yeah
a fleet approaches
they appear to be ravagers

they got my dick message
prove me wrong
yes
yes
were just like kevin bacon
the starboard kern has been breached
we have been boarded
continue our approach
but the nova corps have engaged
none of that will matter once we reach the surface
seal security doors
now
get out of my way
oh man
all nova pilots interlock and form a blockade
the dark aster must not reach the ground
locked in
locked in
were locked in
i can barely see

i want you all to know that i am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders
it is pleasing to once again have
friends

 and this green whore she too  you must stop
gamora look at what you have done you have always been weak

your guardians of the galaxy

but you got some business to attend to
before all the nookienookie starts
peter you cant peter
you gotta reconsider this yondu i dont know who youre selling this to
but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the nova corps
i may be as pretty as an angel
but i sure as hell aint one
hand it over son
yondu
do not open that orb you know that right
youve seen what it does to people
yeah quill turned out okay
its probably good we didnt deliver him to his dad
like we was hired to do
yeah that guy was a jackass
he is gonna be so pissed when he realizes i switched out the orb on him
he was gonna kill you peter
i know
but he was about the only family i had
no
he wasnt
why would you even know this
when we arrested you we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system
so we had it checked out
im not terran
you are half terran
your mother was of earth your father well
hes something very ancient weve never seen here before
that could be why you were able to hold the stone for as long as you did
your friends have arrived
on behalf of the nova corps
wed like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving xandar
if you will follow denarian dey
 he has something to show you  thank you nova prime
your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them
yes
of course ronan was only a puppet
its really thanos i need to kill
we tried to keep it as close to the original as possible
we salvaged as much as we could
i
thank you
i have a family
theyre alive because of you
your criminal records have also been expunged
however i have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future
question what if i see something that i want to take
 and it belongs to someone else  you will be arrested
but what if i want it more than the person who has it
 its still illegal  that doesnt follow
no i want it more sir do you understand what are you laughing at
why i cant have a discussion with this gentleman
what if someone does something irksome
and i decide to remove his spine

tony stark
visionary genius
american patriot
even from an early age
the son of legendary weapons developer howard stark
quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind
at age four he built his first circuit board
at age six his first engine
and at 17 he graduated summa cum laude from mit
then the passing of a titan
howard starks lifelong friend and ally obadiah stane
steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder
until at age 21 the prodigal son returns
and is anointed the new ceo of stark industries
with the keys to the kingdom
tony ushers in a new era for his fathers legacy
creating smarter weapons advanced robotics satellite targeting
today tony stark has changed the face of the weapons industry
by ensuring freedom and protecting america
and her interests around the globe
as liaison to stark industries
ive had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot
he is my friend and he is my great mentor
ladies and gentlemen it is my honor
to present this years apogee award to mr tony stark
tony
 thank you colonel  thanks for the save
this is beautiful thank you thank you all very much
this is wonderful
well im not tony stark
but if i were tony i would tell you how honored i feel
and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award
tony you know
the best thing about tony is also the worst thing
hes always working
work it come on
 we should just stay till the morning  you are unbelievable
 oh no did they rope you into this  nobody roped me into anything
 im so sorry  but they told me that
if i presented you with an award youd be deeply honored
of course id be deeply honored and its you thats great
 so when do we do it  its right here
 here you go  there it is that was easy
 im so sorry  yeah its okay
wow would you look at that thats something else

 yeah you can count on it  im serious
i know i know
render unto caesar that which is caesars there you go
mr stark excuse me mr stark
christine everhart vanity fair magazine
can i ask you a couple of questions
 shes cute  shes all right
 hi  hi
 yeah okay go  its okay
youve been called the da vinci of our time
 what do you say to that  absolutely ridiculous i dont paint
and what do you say to your other nickname
the merchant of death
thats not bad
 let me guess berkeley  brown actually
well ms brown
its an imperfect world but its the only one weve got
i guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace
ill start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals
rehearse that much
every night in front of the mirror before bedtime
 i can see that  id like to show you firsthand
all i want is a serious answer
okay heres serious my old man had a philosophy
peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy
thats a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks
my father helped defeat the nazis he worked on the manhattan project
a lot of people including your professors at brown
would call that being a hero
and a lot of people would also call that war profiteering
tell me do you plan to report on the millions weve saved
by advancing medical technology
or kept from starvation with our intellicrops
all those breakthroughs military funding honey
you ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life
id be prepared to lose a few with you
good morning its 700 am
the weather in malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds
the surf conditions are fair with waisttoshoulder high lines
high tide will be at 1052 am
tony
hey tony
you are not authorized to access this area
 jesus  thats jarvis he runs the house
ive got your clothes here theyve been drycleaned and pressed
and theres a car waiting for you outside
that will take you anywhere youd like to go
 you must be the famous pepper potts  indeed i am
after all these years tony still has you picking up the drycleaning
i do anything and everything that mr stark requires
including occasionally taking out the trash
will that be all
give me an exploded view
the compression in cylinder three appears to be low
log that
 im gonna try again right now  please dont turn down my music
ill keep you posted
you are supposed to be halfway around the world right now
 howd she take it  like a champ
why are you trying to hustle me out of here
your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago
thats funny i thought with it being my plane and all
that it would just wait for me to get there
tony i need to speak to you about a couple things
before i get you out of the door
doesnt it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane
if it departs before you arrive
larry called hes got another buyer for the jackson pollock in the wings
do you want it yes or no
is it a good representation of his spring period
no the springs was actually the neighborhood in east hampton
where he lived and worked
 not spring like the season  so
i think its a fair example i think its incredibly overpriced
i need it buy it store it
okay the mit commencement speech
is in june please dont harangue me about stuff thats way way down
theyre haranguing me so im gonna say yes
deflect it and absorb it dont transmit it back to me
i need you to sign this before you get on the plane
what are you trying to get rid of me for what you got plans
 as a matter of fact i do  i dont like it when you have plans
im allowed to have plans on my birthday
 its your birthday  yes
i knew that already
yeah isnt that strange its the same day as last year
 get yourself something nice from me  i already did
 and  it was very nice
 yeah  very tasteful thank you mr stark
youre welcome miss potts
okay
youre good i thought i lost you back there
you did sir i had to cut across mulholland

waiting on you now lets go come on
wheels up rock and roll
 what you reading platypus  nothing
come on sour patch dont be mad
i told you im not mad im indifferent okay
 i said i was sorry  good morning mr stark
you dont need to apologize to me im your man
hi i told him i was sorry but he
 im just indifferent right now  hot towel
you dont respect yourself
 so i know you dont respect me  i respect you
im just your babysitter
so when you need your diaper changed thank you
let me know and ill get you a bottle okay
hey heat up the sake will you
 thanks for reminding me  no im not talking
were not drinking were working right now
 you cant have sashimi without sake  you are constitutionally

hot sake
 yes two please  no im not drinking i dont want any
thats what im talking about
when i get up in the morning and im putting on my uniform
you know what i recognize
i see in that mirror that every person thats got this uniform on got my back
hey you know what im not like you im not cut out
no no you dont have to be like me but youre more than what you are
can you excuse me if im a bit distracted here
no you cant be distracted right now listen to me
general
welcome mr stark we look forward to your weapons presentation
thanks
is it better to be feared or respected
i say is it too much to ask for both
with that in mind i humbly present the crown jewel
of stark industries freedom line
its the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology
they say the best weapon is one you never have to fire
i respectfully disagree
i prefer the weapon you only have to fire once
thats how dad did it thats how america does it
and its worked out pretty well so far
find an excuse
to let one of these off the chain and i personally guarantee you
the bad guys wont even want to come out of their caves
for your consideration the jericho
ill be throwing one of these in
with every purchase of 500 million or more
to peace
 tony  obie what are you doing up
i couldnt sleep till i found out how it went howd it go
it went great looks like its gonna be an early christmas
hey way to go my boy ill see you tomorrow yeah
why arent you wearing those pajamas i got you
good night tony
 hey tony  im sorry this is the funvee
the humdrumvee is back there
 nice job  see you back at base
i wouldnt do that if i were you
what the hell did you do to me
what i did
what i did is to save your life
i removed all the shrapnel i could but theres a lot left
and its headed into your atrial septum
here want to see
i have a souvenir take a look
ive seen many wounds like that in my village
we call them the walking dead
because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs
 what is this  that is an electromagnet
hooked up to a car battery
and its keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart
thats right smile
we met once you know at a technical conference in bern
 i dont remember  no you wouldnt
if i had been that drunk i wouldnt have been able to stand
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits
where are we
come on stand up stand up
just do as i do
come on put your hands up
those are my guns how did they get my guns
do you understand me do as i do
he says welcome tony stark the most famous mass murderer
in the history of america
he is honored
he wants you to build the missile
the jericho missile that you demonstrated
this one
i refuse
tony
he wants to know what you think
i think you got a lot of my weapons
he says they have everything you need to build the jericho missile
he wants you to make the list of materials
he says for you to start working immediately
and when youre done he will set you free
 no he wont  no he wont
im sure theyre looking for you stark
but they will never find you in these mountains
look what you just saw
that is your legacy stark
your lifes work in the hands of those murderers
is that how you want to go out
is this the last act of defiance of the great tony stark
or are you going to do something about it
why should i do anything theyre going to kill me you either way
and if they dont ill probably be dead in a week
well then
this is a very important week for you isnt it
if this is going to be my work station i want it welllit i want these up
i need welding gear i dont care if its acetylene or propane
i need a soldering station i need helmets im gonna need goggles
i would like a smelting cup i need two sets of precision tools
 how many languages do you speak  a lot
but apparently not enough for this place
they speak arabic urdu
dari pashto mongolian farsi russian
 who are these people  they are your loyal customers sir
they call themselves the ten rings
you know we might be more productive
if you include me in the planning process
okay we dont need this
what is that
thats palladium 015 grams
we need at least 16 so why dont you go break down the other 11
whats he doing
working
careful careful we only get one shot at this
relax i have steady hands
why do you think youre still alive
 what do i call you  my name is yinsen
yinsen nice to meet you
nice to meet you too
that doesnt look like a jericho missile
thats because its a miniaturized arc reactor
i got a big one powering my factory at home
it should keep the shrapnel out of my heart
but what could it generate
if my math is right and it always is three gigajoules per second
that could run your heart for 50 lifetimes
yeah or something big for 15 minutes
 this is our ticket out of here  what is it
flatten them out and look
oh wow
impressive
good
good roll good roll
you still havent told me where youre from
im from a small town called gulmira
 its actually a nice place  got a family
yes and i will see them when i leave here
and you stark
 no  no
so youre a man who has everything
and nothing
it doesnt look anything like the picture
maybe its been modified
the tail is wrong
its just backwards
relax
the bow and arrow
once was the pinnacle of weapons technology
it allowed the great genghis khan
to rule from the pacific to the ukraine
an empire twice the size of alexander the great
and four times the size of the roman empire
but today
whoever holds the latest stark weapons
rules these lands
and soon
it will be my turn

your eyes are red a few tears for your longlost boss
 tears of joy i hate job hunting  yeah vacations over
where to sir
 take us to the hospital please happy  no
no tony you have to
 go to the hospital  no is a complete answer
 the doctor has to look at you  i dont have to do anything
ive been in captivity for three months
there are two things i want to do i want an american cheeseburger
 and the other  thats enough of that
is not what you think i want you to call for a press conference now
 call for a press conference  yeah
 what on earth for  hogan drive cheeseburger first
look at this
tony
 we were going to meet at the hospital  no im fine
look at you
 you had to have a burger yeah  well come on
 you get me one of those  theres only one left i need it
hey look whos here yeah
 miss potts  yes
can i speak to you for a moment
im not part of the press conference but its about to begin right now
im not a reporter
im agent phil coulson
with the strategic homeland intervention enforcement
and logistics division
 thats quite a mouthful  i know were working on it
you know weve been approached already by the dod the fbi the cia
were a separate division with a more specific focus
we need to debrief mr stark about the circumstances of his escape
 ill put something in the book shall i  thank you
hey would it be all right if everyone sat down
why dont you just sit down that way you can see me and i can
a little less formal and
 whats up with the lovein  dont look at me
i dont know what hes up to
 good to see you  good to see you
i never got to say goodbye to dad
i never got to say goodbye to my father
theres questions that i would have asked him
i would have asked him how he felt about what this company did
if he was conflicted if he ever had doubts
or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels
i saw young americans killed
by the very weapons i created to defend them and protect them
and i saw
that i had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability
 mr stark  hey ben
what happened over there
i had my eyes opened i came to realize that i have more
to offer this world than just making things that blow up
and that is why effective immediately i am shutting down
the weapons manufacturing division of stark international
until such a time as i can decide what the future of the company will be
i think were gonna be selling a lot of newspapers
what direction it should take one that im comfortable with
and is consistent with the highest good for this country as well
what we should take away from this is that tonys back
and hes healthier than ever
were going to have a little internal discussion
and well get back to you with the followup
 where is he  hes inside
well that that went well
did i just paint a target on the back of my head
your head what about my head
what do you think the overunder on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow
 optimistically 40 points  at minimum
yep
tony were a weapons manufacturer
obie i just dont want a body count to be our only legacy
thats what we do were iron mongers we make weapons
its my name on the side of the building
and what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos
not based on what i saw
were not doing a good enough job
we can do better were gonna do something else
like what you want us to make baby bottles
i think we should take another look into arc reactor technology
come on the arc reactor thats a publicity stunt
tony come on we built that thing to shut the hippies up
 it works  yeah as a science project
the arc was never cost effective we knew that before we built it
arc reactor technology thats a dead end right
maybe
am i right we havent had a breakthrough in that in what
 thirty years  thats what they say
could you have a lousier poker face just tell me who told you
 never mind who told me show me  its rhodey or pepper
 i want to see it  okay rhodey
 okay  okay
it works
listen to me tony were a team do you understand
theres nothing we cant do if we stick together
like your father and i
im sorry i didnt give you a headsup okay
 but if i had  tony
tony no more of this ready fire aim business
 you understand me  that was dads line
you gotta let me handle this
were gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now
were going to have to take a lot of heat
i want you to promise me that youre gonna lay low
stark industries
ive got one recommendation ready ready
sell sell sell
abandon ship
does the hindenburg ring any bells
let me show you the new stark industries business plan
look thats a weapons company that doesnt make weapons
pepper how big are your hands
 what  how big are your hands
 i dont understand why  get down here i need you
hey
lets see them show me your hands
lets see them
oh wow they are small very petite indeed
i just need your help for a sec
oh my god is that the thing thats keeping you alive
it was it is now an antique
this is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future
im swapping it up for an upgraded unit and i just ran into a little speed bump
 speed bump what does that mean  its nothing its just a little snag
theres an exposed wire under this device
and its contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short
its fine
 what do you want me to do  put that on the table over there
 that is irrelevant  oh my god
i want you to reach in and youre just gonna gently lift the wire out
 is it safe  yeah it should be fine
its like operation you just dont let it touch
the socket wall or it goes beep
 what do you mean operation  its just a game never mind
 just gently lift the wire okay great  okay
you know i dont think that im qualified to do this
no youre fine youre the most capable qualified
trustworthy person ive ever met youre gonna do great
is it too much of a problem to ask cause im
 okay okay  i really need your help here
okay
oh theres pus
its not pus its an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device
 not from my body  it smells
yeah it does
the copper wire the copper wire you got it

the future of air combat is it manned or unmanned
ill tell you in my experience
no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilots instinct
his insight
that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome or a pilots judgment
colonel why not a pilot without the plane
look who fell out of the sky mr tony stark
 hello sir  speaking of manned or unmanned
you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong
at spring break just remember that spring break 1987
 that lovely lady you woke up with  dont do that

ive been buzzing you did you hear the intercom
yeah everythings what
 obadiahs upstairs  great
 what would you like me to tell him  great ill be right up
okay
i thought you said you were done making weapons
it is
this is a flight stabilizer its completely harmless
i didnt expect that
howd it go
it went that bad huh
just because i brought pizza back from new york
 doesnt mean it went bad  sure doesnt oh boy
it would have gone better if you were there
you told me to lay low thats what ive been doing
 i lay low and you take care of all  hey come on in public the press
 this was a board of directors meeting  this was a board of directors meeting
the board is claiming you have posttraumatic stress
theyre filing an injunction
 a what  they want to lock you out
why cause the stocks dipped 40 points
we knew that was gonna happen
 fiftysix and a half  it doesnt matter
we own the controlling interest in the company
tony the board has rights too
theyre making the case that you and your new direction
 isnt in the companys best interest  im being responsible
thats a new direction for me for the company
i mean me on the companys behalf being responsible for the way that
this is great
 oh come on tony tony  ill be in the shop
hey hey hey tony listen
im trying to turn this thing around but you gotta give me something
something to pitch them
let me have the engineers analyze that you know draw up some specs
 no no absolutely not  itll give me a bone to throw the boys
 in new york  this one stays with me
 thats it obie forget it  all right well this stays with me then
go on here you can have a piece
 take two  thank you
you mind if i come down there and see what youre doing
good night obie
day 11 test 37 configuration 20 for lack of a better option
dummy is still on fire safety if you douse me again
and im not on fire im donating you to a city college
all right nice and easy
seriously just gonna start off with 1 thrust capacity
and three two one
okay
please dont follow me around with it either
cause i feel like im gonna catch on fire spontaneously
just stand down if something happens then come in
and again lets bring it up to 25
three two one
okay this is where i dont want to be
not the car not the car
table
could be worse could be worse were fine okay
no
yeah i can fly
 jarvis are you there  at your service sir
 engage heads up display  check
import all preferences from home interface
will do sir
all right what do you say
i have indeed been uploaded sir were online and ready
can we start the virtual walkaround
importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment
do a check on control surfaces
as you wish
test complete preparing to power down and begin diagnostics
yeah tell you what do a weather and atc check
start listening in on ground control
sir there are still terabytes
of calculations needed before an actual flight is
jarvis sometimes you got to run before you can walk
ready in three two one
handles like a dream
all right lets see what this thing can do
whats sr71 s record
the altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85000 feet sir
records are made to be broken come on
sir there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring
keep going
higher
we iced up jarvis deploy flaps jarvis
come on we got to break the ice
kill power
notes main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude
hull pressurization is problematic im thinking icing is the probable factor
a very astute observation sir
perhaps if you intend to visit other planets
we should improve the exosystems
connect to the sys co have it reconfigure the shell metals
use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite
that should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining powertoweight ratio
 got it  yes
shall i render using proposed specifications
thrill me
tonights redhot red carpet is right here at the disney concert hall
where tony starks third annual benefit for the firefighters family fund
has become the place to be for las high society
jarvis we get an invite for that
i have no record of an invitation sir
hasnt been seen in public
since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference
some claim hes suffering from posttraumatic stress
and has been bedridden for weeks whatever the case may be
no one expects an appearance from him tonight
the render is complete
a little ostentatious dont you think
what was i thinking youre usually so discreet
tell you what throw a little hotrod red in there
yes that should help you keep a low profile
the render is complete
hey i like it fabricate it paint it
commencing automated assembly
estimated completion time is five hours
dont wait up for me honey
weapons manufacturing is only one small part of what stark industries
is all about and our partnership with the fire and rescue community
 hey tony remember me  sure dont
you look great hef
were going to have a great quarter
whats the world coming to when a guys got to crash his own party
look at you hey what a surprise
ill see you inside
hey listen take it slow all right
i think i got the board right where we want them
you got it just cabin fever ill just be a minute
 give me a scotch im starving  mr stark
 yeah  agent coulson
oh yeah yeah yeah the guy from the
strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division
god you need a new name for that
yeah i hear that a lot
listen i know this must be a trying time for you but we need to debrief you
theres still a lot of unanswered questions
and time can be a factor with these things
lets just put something on the books
how about the 24th at 700 pm at stark industries
tell you what you got it youre absolutely right
well im going to go to my assistant and well make a date
you look fantastic i didnt recognize you
 what are you doing here  just avoiding government agents
 are you by yourself  yes whered you get that dress
 oh it was a birthday present  thats great
 from you actually  well i got great taste
yes
 you want to dance  oh no
 all right come on  thank you no
am i making you uncomfortable
no no i always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss
in front of everyone that i work with in a dress with no back
 you look great and you smell great  oh god
but i could fire you if that would take the edge off
i actually dont think that you could tie your shoes without me
 id make it a week sure  really
whats your social security number
 five  five
 right  right
youre missing just a couple of digits there
the other eight so i got you for the other eight
 how about a little air  yes i need some air
 that was totally weird  totally harmless
it was totally not harmless by the way
were dancing no ones even watching
everybody who i work with no you know why
i think you lost objectivity i think they just people we just danced
no it was not just a dance you dont understand because youre you
and everybody knows exactly who you are
and how you are with girls and all of that which is completely fine
but you know then me youre my boss
 and im dancing with you  i dont think it was taken that way
because it makes me look like the one whos trying to
 i just think youre overstating it  you know and were here
and then im wearing this ridiculous
dress and then we were dancing like that and
 i would like a drink please  got it okay
 i would like a vodka martini please  okay
very dry with olives a lot of olives like at least three olives
two vodka martinis extra dry extra olives extra fast
make one of them dirty will you
wow tony stark
 oh hey  fancy seeing you here
 carrie  christine
thats right
you have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight
can i at least get a reaction from you
panic i would say panic is my reaction
cause i was referring to your companys
involvement in this latest atrocity
yeah they just put my name on the invitation i dont know what to tell you
i actually almost bought it hook line and sinker
i was out of town for a couple months in case you didnt hear
is this what you call accountability
its a town called gulmira heard of it
 when were these taken  yesterday
 i didnt approve any shipment  well your company did
well im not my company
 please do you mind  have you seen these pictures
 whats going on in gulmira  tony tony
 you cant afford to be this naive  you know what i was naive before
when they said heres the line we dont cross it
this is how we do business
if were doubledealing under the table are we
tony your picture please
lets take a picture come on picture time
tony who do you think locked you out
i was the one who filed the injunction against you
it was the only way i could protect you
no no
the 15mile hike to the outskirts of gulmira can only be described
as a descent into hell into a modern day heart of darkness
simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages
have been driven from their homes
displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a newfound power
villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings
they can find in the ruins of other villages
or here in the remnants of an old soviet smelting plant
recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters
referred to by locals as the ten rings
as you can see these men are heavily armed and on a mission
a mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way
with no political will or international pressure
theres very little hope for these refugees
around me a woman begging for news on her husband
who was kidnapped by insurgents
either forced to join their militia
desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs
holding them up to anyone who will stop
a childs simple question where are my mother and father
theres very little hope for these refugees
refugees who can only wonder who if anyone will help
hurry it up
put the women in the trucks
stack the weapons here
clear all the houses
that one there faster faster
grab that dog
put him with the others
what the hell is this
shoot this dog
youre all incompetent
turn your head
hes all yours
what the hell was that were we cleared to go in there
no they were using human shields we never got the green light
put me through to state theyre going to be all over this
get those monitors up
we got a bogey
 wasnt air force  we got the cia on the line
ive got langley on the line they want to know if its us
no it definitely is not us sir
 it wasnt navy  wasnt marines
i need answers can i please get eyes on target
 negative negative  cannot identify
get me colonel rhodes from weapons development down here now
we ran an id check and crossreferenced
with all known databases we have nothing
any high altitude surveillance in the region
we got an awac and a global hawk in the area
so this thing just appeared out of nowhere
how come it didnt show up on the radar
got a minimal radar crosssection sir
 is it stealth  no sir its tiny
we think its an unmanned aerial vehicle
colonel what are we dealing with here
 let me make a call  sergeant clear a hole
 hello  tony
 whos this  its rhodes
 sorry hello  i said its rhodes
 speak up please  what in the hell is that noise
 oh yeah im driving with the top down  yeah well i need your help right now
its funny how that works huh
yeah speaking of funny weve got a weapons depot that was just blown up
a few clicks from where you were being held captive
well thats a hot spot
sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you huh
why do you sound out of breath tony
im not i was just jogging in the canyon
 i thought you were driving  right i was driving
to the canyon where im going to jog
you sure you dont have any tech in that area i should know about
 nope  bogey spotted
 whiplash come in hot  okay good cause im staring at one
right now and its about to be blown to kingdom come
thats my exit
ballroom this is whiplash one ive got the bogey in my sights
whiplash one what is it
ive got no idea
 you have radio contact  non responsive sir
then you are clear to engage
hit it
that bogey just went supersonic i got a lock
 inbound missile  flares

holy
that thing just jumped off the radar sir
the sat visual has been lost
no way thats a uav
what is it
i cant see anything
whatever it was it just bought the farm
i think bogeys been handled sir
 hello  hi rhodey its me
 its who  im sorry it is me
you asked what you were asking about is me
no see this isnt a game
you do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone
 you understand that  this is not a piece of equipment
im in it its a suit its me
rhodey you got anything for me

good chute good chute
 tony you still there  hey thanks
oh my god you crazy son of a bitch
you owe me a plane you know that right
yeah well technically he hit me
now are you going to come by and see what im working on
no no no no no no the less i know the better
now what am i supposed to tell the press
training exercise isnt that the usual bs
its not that simple
an unfortunate training exercise
involving an f22 raptor occurred yesterday
i am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured
as for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in gulmira
it is still unclear who or what intervened
but i can assure you that the united states government was not involved
hey
it is a tight fit sir
sir the more you struggle the more this is going to hurt
be gentle this is my first time
i designed this to come off so hey
 i really should be able to  please try not to move sir
whats going on here
lets face it this is not the worst thing youve caught me doing
are those bullet holes
welcome
compliments of tony stark
if youd killed him when you were supposed to youd still have a face
you paid us trinkets to kill a prince
show me the weapon
come leave your guards outside
his escape bore unexpected fruit
so this is how he did it
this is only a first crude effort
stark has perfected his design
he has made a masterpiece of death
a man with a dozen of these can rule all of asia
and you dream of starks throne
we have a common enemy
if we are still in business
i will give you these designs
as a gift
and in turn
i hope youll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers
this is the only gift you shall receive
technology
its always been your achilles heel in this part of the world
dont worry itll only last for 15 minutes
thats the least of your problems
crate up the armor and the rest of it
all right lets finish up here
set up sector 16 underneath the arc reactor
and im going to want this data masked recruit our top engineers
i want a prototype right away
hey you busy you mind if i send you on an errand
i need you to go to my office
youre going to hack into the mainframe and youre going to retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests this is a lock chip
thisll get you in
its probably under executive files
if not they put it on a ghost drive in which case you need
to look for the lowest numeric heading
and what do you plan to do with this information if i bring it back here
same drill
theyve been dealing under the table and im going to stop them
im going to find my weapons and destroy them
tony
you know that i would help you with anything
but i cannot help you if youre going to start all of this again
there is nothing except this theres no art opening
there is no benefit there is nothing to sign
there is the next mission and nothing else
is that so
well then i quit
you stood by my side all these years
while i reaped the benefits of destruction
and now that im trying to protect the people
that i put in harms way youre going to walk out
youre going to kill yourself tony im not going to be a part of it
i shouldnt be alive
unless it was for a reason
im not crazy pepper
i just finally know what i have to do
and i know in my heart that its right
youre all i have too you know
sector 16 what are you up to obadiah
you did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great tony stark
 as you can see obadiah stane  oh my god
your deception and lies will cost you dearly
the price to kill tony stark has just gone up
so what are we going to do about this
i know what youre going through pepper
tony he always gets the good stuff doesnt he
i was so happy when he came home
it was like we got him back from the dead
now i realize
well tony never really did come home did he
he left a part of himself in that cave
breaks my heart
well hes a complicated person
hes been through a lot i think hell be all right
you are a very rare woman
tony doesnt know how lucky he is
thank you thanks
id better get back there
is that todays paper
yes
do you mind
 not at all  puzzle
of course
take care
ms potts we had an appointment did you forget about our appointment
nope right now come with me
 right now  were going to have it right now
 yeah walk with me  okay
im going to give you the meeting of your life your office
yeah weve been working our best to do it
absolutely were im going to have to call you back
mr stane sir weve explored
what youve asked us and it seems as though theres a little hiccup
 actually  a hiccup
yes to power the suit sir the technology actually doesnt exist
 so its  wait wait wait the technology
william here is the technology ive asked you to simply make it smaller
okay sir and thats what were trying to do but honestly its impossible
tony stark was able to build this in a cave with a box of scraps
well im sorry im not tony stark
tony
tony are you there hello
breathe
easy easy
you remember this one right
its a shame the government didnt approve it
theres so many applications for causing shortterm paralysis
tony
when i ordered the hit on you
i worried that i was
killing the golden goose
but you see it was just
fate that you survived that
you had one last golden egg to give
do you really think that just because you have an idea it belongs to you
your father he helped give us the atomic bomb
now what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you
oh its beautiful
tony this is your ninth symphony
what a masterpiece look at that
this is your legacy
a new generation of weapons with this at its heart
weapons that will help steer the world back on course
put the balance of power in our hands
the right hands
i wish you could see my prototype
its not as
well not as conservative as yours
too bad you had to involve pepper in this
i would have preferred that she lived
what do you mean he paid to have tony killed
pepper slow down why would obadiah
okay wheres tony now
i dont know hes not answering his phone
please go over there and make sure everythings okay
thank you rhodey i know a shortcut
good boy
tony
tony
tony you okay
 wheres pepper  shes fine shes with five agents
theyre about to arrest obadiah
thats not going to be enough
section 16 section 16 there it is
my keys not working its not opening the door
oh wow whats that its like a little device
its like a thing thats going to pick the lock
you might want to take a few steps back
thats the coolest thing ive ever seen
not bad huh lets do it
you need me to do anything else
keep the skies clear
damn
next time baby
looks like you were right he was building a suit
i thought itd be bigger
take him out
how do you think the mark i chest piece is going to hold up
the suits at 48 power and falling sir
that chest piece was never designed for sustained flight
keep me posted
pepper
 tony tony are you okay  im fine how are
 obadiah hes gone insane  i know
 listen youd better get out of there  he built a suit
get out of there right now
where do you think youre going
your services are no longer required
stane
i love this suit
 put them down  collateral damage tony
divert power to chest rt
power reduced to 19
lady
no no no no no no
for 30 years ive been holding you up
i built this company from nothing
nothing is going to stand in my way
least of all you
impressive youve upgraded your armor
ive made some upgrades of my own
sir it appears that his suit can fly
duly noted take me to maximum altitude
with only 15 power the odds of reaching that
i know the math do it
sir youre not going to believe this that thing is back
get me major allen scramble the jets
not necessary people just a training exercise
yes sir
 thirteen percent power sir  climb
 eleven percent  keep going
 seven percent power  just leave it on the screen
stop telling me
you had a great idea tony but my suit is more advanced in every way
howd you solve the icing problem
icing problem
might want to look into it
two percent
we are now running on emergency backup power
 potts  tony oh my god are you okay
im almost out of power ive got to get out of this thing ill be right there
nice try
 weapons status  repulsors offline missiles offline
flares
very clever tony
 potts  tony
this isnt working
were going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof
 well how are you going to do that  youre going to do it
go to the central console open up all the circuits
when i get clear of the roof ill let you know
youre going to hit the master bypass button
its going to fry everything up here
okay im going in now
make sure you wait till i clear the roof ill buy you some time
this looks important
i never had a taste for this sort of thing
but i must admit im deeply enjoying the suit
you finally outdid yourself tony
youd have made your father proud
its ready tony get off the roof
tony
how ironic tony
trying to rid the world of weapons you gave it its best one ever
 pepper  and now im going to kill you with it
 you ripped out my targeting system  time to hit the button
 you told me not to  hold still you little prick
 just do it  youll die
push it
tony
youve all received the official statement of what occurred
at stark industries last night
there have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned
and caused damage to the arc reactor
fortunately a member of tony starks personal security staff
iron man thats kind of catchy its got a nice ring to it
i mean its not technically accurate the suits a goldtitanium alloy
but its kind of evocative the imagery anyway
heres your alibi
okay
 you were on your yacht  yeah
we have port papers that put you in avalon all night
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests
see i was thinking maybe we should say it was just pepper and me
alone on the island
 thats what happened  all right
just read it word for word
theres nothing about stane here
thats being handled hes on vacation
small aircraft have such a poor safety record
but what about the whole cover story that its a bodyguard
hes my i mean is that thats kind of flimsy dont you think
this isnt my first rodeo mr stark
just stick to the official statement and soon this will all be behind you
youve got 90 seconds
agent coulson
i just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help
thats what we do youll be hearing from us
 from the strategic homeland  just call us shield
right
 lets get this show on the road  you know its actually not that bad
even i dont think im iron man
 youre not iron man  am so
 youre not  all right suit yourself
you know if i were iron man id have this girlfriend who knew my true identity
shed be a wreck cause shed always be worrying that i was going to die
yet so proud of the man id become
shed be wildly conflicted which would only make her more
crazy about me
tell me you never think about that night
 what night  you know
are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof
and then you went downstairs to get me a drink
and you left me there by myself
is that the night youre talking about
thought so
 will that be all mr stark  yes that will be all miss potts
and now mr stark has prepared a statement
he will not be taking any questions thank you
been a while since i was in front of you i figure ill stick to the cards this time
theres been speculation that i was involved in the events that occurred
on the freeway and the rooftop
im sorry mr stark but do you honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared
 despite the fact that you  i know that its confusing
it is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely
to make wild accusations or insinuate that im a superhero
i never said you were a superhero
didnt well good because that would be outlandish and fantastic
im just not the hero type clearly
with this laundry list of character defects
all the mistakes ive made
 largely public  just stick to the cards man
yeah okay yeah
the truth is
i am iron man
jarvis
welcome home sir
i am iron man you think youre the only superhero in the world
mr stark youve become part of a bigger universe
you just dont know it yet

hostages en route to extraction
romanoff missed the rendezvous point cap
hostiles are still in play
natasha batrocs on the move
circle back to rumlow and protect the hostages
natasha
i thought you were more than just a shield
lets see
well this is awkward
what are you doing
backing up the hard drive
its a good habit to get into
rumlow needed your help
what the hell are you doing here
youre saving shield intel
whatever i can get my hands on
our mission is to rescue hostages
no thats your mission
and youve done it beautifully
you just jeopardized this whole operation
i think thats overstating things
okay
that ones on me
youre damn right
you just cant stop yourself from lying can you
i didnt lie
agent romanoff had a different mission than yours
which you didnt feel obliged to share
im not obliged to do anything
those hostages could have died nick
i sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didnt happen
soldiers trust each other thats what makes it an army
not a bunch of guys running around shooting guns
last time i trusted someone i lost an eye
look i didnt want you doing anything you werent comfortable with
agent romanoff is comfortable with everything
i cant lead a mission
when the people im leading have missions of their own
its called compartmentalization
nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all
except you
youre wrong about me
i do share
im nice like that
 insight bay  captain rogers does not have
clearance for project insight
director override fury nicholas j
confirmed
you know they used to play music
yeah
my grandfather operated one of these things for 40 years
granddad worked in a nice building
got good tips
hed walk home every night a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag
hed say hi
people would say hi back
time went on the neighborhood got rougher
hed say hi
theyd say keep on steppin
granddad got to gripping that lunch bag a little tighter
did he ever get mugged
every week some punk would say whats in the bag
what would he do
hed show them
bunch of crumpled ones and a loaded 22 magnum
yeah granddad loved people
but he didnt trust them very much
yeah i know
theyre a little bit bigger than a 22
this is project insight
three nextgeneration helicarriers
synced to a network of targeting satellites
launched from the lemurian star
once we get them in the air they never need to come down
continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulsor engines
stark
he had a few suggestions
once he got an upclose look at our old turbines
these new longrange precision guns
can eliminate 1000 hostiles a minute
the satellites can read a terrorists dna before he steps outside his spider hole
were gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen
thought the punishment usually came after the crime
we cant afford to wait that long
whos we
after new york i convinced the world security council
we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis
for once were way ahead of the curve
by holding a gun to everyone on earth and calling it protection
you know i read those ssr files
greatest generation
you guys did some nasty stuff
yeah we compromised
sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well
but we did it so that people could be free
this isnt freedom this is fear
shield takes the world as it is not as wed like it to be
and its getting damn near past time for you to get with that program cap
dont hold your breath
welcome to the smithsonian
visitor information booths are available on the second level
a symbol to the nation
a hero to the world
the story of captain america is one of honor bravery and sacrifice
denied enlistment due to poor health
steven rogers was chosen for a program
unique in the annals of american warfare
one that would transform him into the worlds first supersoldier
in this rare footage
everyones favorite war hero captain america
battle tested
captain america
and his howling commandos quickly earned their stripes
their mission
taking down hydra the nazi rogue science division
best friends since childhood
bucky barnes and steven rogers were inseparable
on both schoolyard and battlefield
barnes is the only howling commando to give his life
in service of his country
that was a difficult winter
a blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the german line
steve captain rogers
he fought his way through a hydra blockade
that had pinned our allies down for months
he saved over 1000 men
including the man who would
who would become my husband as it turned out
even after he died steve was still changing my life
you should be proud of yourself peggy
i have lived a life
my only regret is that you didnt get to live yours
what is it
for as long as i can remember i just wanted to do what was right
i guess im not quite sure what that is anymore
and i thought i could throw myself back in and follow orders
serve
its just not the same
youre always so dramatic
look you saved the world
we rather mucked it up
you didnt
knowing that you helped found shield is half the reason i stay
hey
the world has changed and none of us can go back
all we can do is our best
and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over
peggy
steve
yeah
youre alive
you came back
yeah peggy
its been so long
so long
well i couldnt leave my best girl
not when she owes me a dance
secure office

decryption failed
director override fury nicholas j
override denied all files sealed
on whose authority
fury nicholas j
world security council
confirmed
if nick fury thinks he can get his costumed thugs
and strike commandos to mop up his mess hes sadly mistaken
this failure is unacceptable
considering this attack took place
one mile from my countrys sovereign waters
its a bit more than that i move for immediate hearing
we dont need hearings we need action
its this councils duty to oversee shield
a breach like this raises serious questions
like how the hell did a french pirate
manage to hijack a covert shield vessel in broad daylight
for the record councilman hes algerian
i can draw a map if itd help
i appreciate your wit secretary pierce
but this council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously
really i dont
i dont care about one boat i care about the fleet
if this council is going to fall to rancor
every time someone pushes us on the playing field
maybe we need someone to oversee us
mr secretary nobody is suggesting
excuse me
more trouble mr secretary
depends on your definition
i work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit
a nuclear war would do it too
you busy in there
nothing some earmarks cant fix
im here to ask a favor
i want you to call for a vote
project insight has to be delayed
nick thats not a favor
thats a subcommittee hearing along one
it could be nothing it probably is nothing
i just need time to make sure its nothing
but if its something
then well both be damn glad those helicarriers arent in the air
fine
but you got to get iron man to stop by my nieces birthday party
thank you sir
and not just a flyby hes got to mingle
the thing is
i think its getting worse
a cop pulled me over last week
he thought i was drunk
i swerved to miss a plastic bag
i thought it was an ied
some stuff you leave there
other stuff you bring back
its our job to figure out how to carry it
is it gonna be in a big suitcase or in a little manpurse
its up to you
 ill see you next week  definitely
look who it is the running man
caught the last few minutes its pretty intense
yeah brother we all got the same problems
guilt
regret
you lose someone
my wingman riley
flying a night mission
standard pj rescue op
nothing we hadnt done 1000 times before
until an rpg knocked rileys dumb ass out of the sky
nothing i could do
its like i was up there just to watch
 im sorry  after that
i had a really hard time finding a reason for being over there you know
but youre happy now back in the world
the number of people giving me orders is down to about zero
so hell yeah
are you thinking about getting out
no
i dont know
to be honest i dont know what i would do with myself if i did
ultimate fighting
just a great idea off the top of my head
seriously you could do whatever you want to do
what makes you happy

i need to take him
natasha
natasha
why was fury in your apartment
i dont know
cap they want you back at shield
yeah give me a second
they want you now
okay
youre a terrible liar
strike team escort captain rogers
back to shield immediately for questioning
i told him
 lets go  yeah
strike move it out
captain rogers
neighbor
captain
im alexander pierce
sir its an honor
the honors mine captain
my father served in the 101st come on in
that photo was taken five years after nick and i met
when i was at state department in bogota
eln rebels took the embassy
and security got me out but the rebels took hostages
nick was deputy chief of the shield station there
and he comes to me with a plan
he wants to storm the building through the sewers
i said no well negotiate
turned out the eln didnt negotiate so they put out a kill order
they stormed the basement and what do they find
they find it empty
nick had ignored my direct order
and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil
and saved the lives of a dozen political officers
including my daughter
so you gave him a promotion
ive never had any cause to regret it
captain why was nick in your apartment last night
i dont know
did you know it was bugged
i did because nick told me
did he tell you he was the one who bugged it
i want you to see something
who hired you batroc
is that live
yeah they picked him up last night in a notsosafe house in algiers
are you saying hes a suspect assassination isnt batrocs line
no no its more complicated than that
batroc was hired anonymously to attack the lemurian star
and he was contacted by email and paid by wire transfer
and then the money was run through 17 fictitious accounts
the last one going to a holding company
that was registered to a jacob veech
am i supposed to know who that is
not likely veech died six years ago
his last address was 1435 elmhurst drive
when i first met nick his mother lived at 1437
are you saying fury hired the pirates why
the prevailing theory
was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition
and sale of classified intelligence
the sale went sour and that led to nicks death
if you really knew nick fury youd know thats not true
why do you think were talking
see i took a seat on the council not because i wanted to
but because nick asked me to because we were both realists
we knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric
to build a really better world
sometimes means having to tear the old one down
and that makes enemies
those people that call you dirty because you got the guts
to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better
and the idea that those people could be happy today
makes me really really angry
captain you were the last one to see nick alive
i dont think thats an accident
and i dont think you do either
so im gonna ask again
why was he there
he told me not to trust anyone
i wonder if that included him
im sorry
those were his last words
excuse me
captain
somebody murdered my friend and im gonna find out why
anyone gets in my way theyre gonna regret it
anyone
understood
operations control
confirmed
keep all strike personnel on site
 understood  yes sir
 forensics  confirmed
cap
rumlow
evidence response found some fibers on the roof they want us to see
you want me to get the tac team ready
no lets wait and see what it is first
right
whats the status so far
 administrations level  confirmed
excuse me
im sorry about what happened with fury
its messed up what happened to him
thank you
records
confirmed
before we get started
does anyone want to get out
mobilize strike units 25th floor
whoa big guy
i just want you to know cap this isnt personal
it kind of feels personal
drop the shield and put your hands in the air
give it up rogers get that door open
you have nowhere to go
are you kidding me
hes headed for the garage lock down the bridge
stand down captain rogers stand down
repeat stand down
eyes here
whatever your op is bury it
this is level one
contact dot
all traffic lights in the district go red
shut all runways at bwi
iad and reagan
all security cameras in the city go through this monitor right here
scan all open sources
phones computers
pdas whatever
if someone tweets about this guy
i want to know about it
with all due respect if shield is conducting
a manhunt for captain america we deserve to know why
because he lied to us
captain rogers has information regarding the death of director fury
he refused to share it
as difficult as this is to accept
captain america is a fugitive from shield
 where is it  safe
 do better  where did you get it
why would i tell you
fury gave it to you why
 whats on it  i dont know
stop lying
i only act like i know everything rogers
i bet you knew fury hired the pirates didnt you
well it makes sense the ship was dirty fury needed a way in so do you
im not gonna ask you again
i know who killed fury
most of the intelligence community doesnt believe he exists
the ones that do call him the winter soldier
hes credited with over two dozen assassinations
in the last 50 years
so hes a ghost story
five years ago i was escorting a nuclear engineer out of iran
somebody shot out my tires near odessa
we lost control went straight over a cliff
i pulled us out
but the winter soldier was there
i was covering my engineer so he shot him
straight through me
soviet slug
no rifling byebye bikinis
yeah i bet you look terrible in them now
going after him is a dead end i know ive tried
like you said hes a ghost story
well lets find out what the ghost wants
nick fury was murdered in cold blood
to any reasonable person
that would make him a martyr not a traitor
you know what makes him a traitor
hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship
nick fury used your friendship
to coerce this council into delaying project insight
a project he knew would expose his own illegal operations
at best he lied to you at worst
are you calling for my resignation
ive got a pen and paper right here
that discussion can be tabled for a later time
but you do want to have a discussion
weve already had it mr secretary
this council moves to immediately reactivate project insight
if you want to say something snappy now would be a good time
first rule of going on the run is dont run walk
if i run in these shoes theyre gonna fall off
the drive has a level six homing program so as soon as we boot up
shield will know exactly where we are
how much time will we have
about nine minutes from
now
fury was right about that ship
somebodys trying to hide something
this drive is protected by some sort of ai
it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands
can you override it
the person who developed this is slightly smarter than me
slightly
im gonna try running a tracer
this is a program that shield developed
to track hostile malware
so if we cant read the file
maybe we can find out where it came from
can i help you guys with anything
no my fianc was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations
right were getting married
congratulations where are you guys thinking about going
new jersey
i have the exact same glasses
wow you two are practically twins
yeah i wish
specimen
if you guys need anything ive been aaron
thank you
 you said nine minutes come on  relax
got it
you know it
i used to lets go
standard tac team
two behind two across
and two coming straight at us
if they make us ill engage you hit the south escalator to the metro
shut up and put your arm around me laugh at something i said
 what  do it
negative at the source
give me a floor rundown
negative on three
negative on two
snake the upper levels work down to me
 kiss me  what
public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable
yes they do
you still uncomfortable
its not exactly the word i would use
where did captain america learn how to steal a car
nazi germany
and were borrowing take your feet off the dash
all right i have a question for you which you do not have to answer
i feel like if you dont answer it though
 youre kind of answering it you know  what
was that your first kiss since 1945
 that bad huh  i didnt say that
well it kind of sounds like thats what youre saying
no i didnt
i just wondered how much practice youve had
 you dont need practice  everybody needs practice
it was not my first kiss since 1945
im 95 im not dead
nobody special though
believe it or not its kind of hard
to find someone with shared life experience
well thats all right you just make something up
 what like you  i dont know
the truth is a matter of circumstance
its not all things to all people all the time
neither am i
thats a tough way to live
its a good way not to die though
you know its kind of hard to trust someone
when you dont know who that someone really is
yeah
who do you want me to be
how about a friend
well theres a chance you might be in the wrong business rogers
this is it
the file came from these coordinates
so did i
this camp is where i was trained
change much
a little
pick up the pace ladies
lets go lets go
double time
come on rogers move it
come on fall in
rogers
i said fall in
this is a dead end
zero heat signatures zero waves not even radio
whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off
what is it
army regulations forbid storing munitions
within 500 yards of the barracks
this building is in the wrong place
this is shield
maybe where it started
and theres starks father
howard
whos the girl
if youre already working in a secret office
why do you need to hide the elevator
this cant be the data point this technology is ancient
yes spells yes
shall we play a game
 its from a movie that was really  i know i saw it
rogers steven
born 1918
romanoff natalia alianovna
born 1984
its some kind of recording
i am not a recording fraulein
i may not be the man i was
when the captain took me prisoner in 1945
but i am
you know this thing
arnim zola was a german scientist who worked for the red skull
hes been dead for years
first correction i am swiss
second look around you
i have never been more alive
in 1972 i received a terminal diagnosis
science could not save my body
my mind however that was worth saving
on 200000 feet of databanks
you are standing in my brain
 how did you get here  invited
it was operation paperclip after world war ii
shield recruited german scientists with strategic value
they thought i could help their cause
i also helped my own
hydra died with the red skull
cut off one head two more shall take its place
prove it
accessing archive
hydra was founded on the belief that humanity
could not be trusted with its own freedom
what we did not realize was that if you try
to take that freedom they resist
the war taught us much
humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly
after the war shield was founded
and i was recruited
the new hydra grew
a beautiful parasite inside shield
for 70 years
hydra has been secretly feeding crisis reaping war
and when history did not cooperate
history was changed
thats impossible shield would have stopped you
accidents will happen
hydra created a world so chaotic
that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom
to gain its security
once a purification process is complete
hydras new world order will arise
we won captain
your death amounts to the same as your life
a zero sum
as i was saying
whats on this drive
project insight requires insight
so i wrote an algorithm
what kind of algorithm what does it do
the answer to your question is fascinating
unfortunately you shall be too dead to hear it
steve we got a bogey
short range ballistic
 30 seconds tops  who fired it
shield
i am afraid i have been stalling captain
admit it
its better this way
we are both of us
out of time
call in the asset
im going to go mr pierce
you need anything before i leave
no its fine renata you can go home
okay nightnight
good night
want some milk
the timetable has moved
our window is limited
two targets level six
they already cost me zola
i want confirmed death in 10 hours
sorry mr pierce i
i forgot my
phone
renata i wish you would have knocked
hey man
im sorry about this we need a place to lay low
everyone we know is trying to kill us
not everyone
 you okay  yeah
whats going on
when i first joined shield i thought i was going straight
but i guess i just traded in the kgb for hydra
i thought i knew whose lies i was telling
but i guess i cant tell the difference anymore
theres a chance you might be in the wrong business
i owe you
its okay
if it was the other way around
and it was down to me to save your life
now you be honest with me
would you trust me to do it
i would now
and im always honest
well you seem pretty chipper
for someone who just found out they died for nothing
well guess i just like to know who im fighting
i made breakfast
if you guys eat that sort of thing
so the question is
who at shield could launch a domestic missile strike
pierce
who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world
but hes not working alone
zolas algorithm was on the lemurian star
so was jasper sitwell
so the real question is how do the two most wanted people
in washington kidnap a shield officer in broad daylight
the answer is you dont
 whats this  call it a rsum
is this bakhmala
the khalid khandil mission that was you
you didnt say he was a pararescue
 is this riley  yeah
i heard they couldnt bring in the choppers because of the rpgs
what did you use a stealth chute
no
these
i thought you said you were a pilot
i never said pilot
i cant ask you to do this sam
you got out for a good reason
dude captain america needs my help
theres no better reason to get back in
where can we get our hands on one of these things
the last one is at fort meade
behind three guarded gates and a 12inch steel wall
shouldnt be a problem
listen i got to fly home tonight
because i got some constituency problem
and i got to press the flesh
any constituent in particular mr senator
no not really
twentythree kind of hot
real hot you know
wants to be a reporter i think i dont know
who listens at that point
doesnt sound like much of a problem to me
really because shes killing my back
but this isnt the place to talk about it
this is a nice pin
 thank you  come here
hail hydra
 see its right there  yeah i just saw that
 should i get it checked  i think you should
i need a minute
bring the car around
yes sir
agent sitwell how was lunch
i hear the crab cakes here are delicious
who is this
the goodlooking guy in the sunglasses your 10 oclock
your other 10 oclock
there you go
what do you want
youre gonna go around the corner to your right
theres a gray car two spaces down
you and i are gonna take a ride
and why would i do that
because that tie looks really expensive
and id hate to mess it up
tell me about zolas algorithm
never heard of it
what were you doing on the lemurian star
i was throwing up i get seasick
is this little display meant to insinuate that youre gonna throw me off the roof
because its really not your style rogers
youre right
its not
its hers
wait what about that girl from accounting laura
lillian lip piercing right
yeah shes cute
yeah im not ready for that
zolas algorithm is a program
for choosing
 insights targets  what targets
you
a tv anchor in cairo the under secretary of defense
a high school valedictorian in iowa city
bruce banner stephen strange anyone whos a threat
to hydra
now or in the future
in the future how could it know
how could it not
the 21st century is a digital book
zola taught hydra how to read it
your bank records
medical histories voting patterns
emails phone calls your damn sat scores
zolas algorithm evaluates peoples past
to predict their future
and what then
oh my god pierce is gonna kill me
what then
then the insight helicarriers scratch people off the list
a few million at a time
hydra doesnt like leaks
then why dont you try sticking a cork in it
insights launching in 16 hours
were cutting it a little bit close here
i know well use him to bypass the dna scans
and access the helicarriers directly
what are you crazy
that is a terrible terrible idea
shit
hang on
i have her find him
go i got this
taking fire above and below expressway
civilians threatened repeat civilians threatened
i make an lz 2300 block of virginia avenue
rendezvous two minutes
get out of the way
stay out of the way
bucky
who the hell is bucky
drop the shield cap get on your knees
get on your knees
get down get down get on your knees
down
dont move
put the gun down
not here not here
it was him
he looked right at me like he didnt even know me
how is that even possible it was like 70 years ago
zola
buckys whole unit was captured in 43
zola experimented on him
whatever he did helped bucky survive the fall
they must have found him and
none of thats your fault steve
even when i had nothing i had bucky
we need to get a doctor here
if we dont put pressure on that wound
shes gonna bleed out here in the truck
that thing was squeezing my brain
who is this guy
three holes start digging
gsw shes lost at least a pint
maybe two
 let me take her  shell want to see him first
about damn time
lacerated spinal column
cracked sternum
shattered collarbone
perforated liver
and one hell of a headache
dont forget your collapsed lung
lets not forget that
otherwise im good
they cut you open your heart stopped
tetrodotoxin b
slows the pulse to one beat a minute
banner developed it for stress
didnt work so great for him but we found a use for it
why all the secrecy why not just tell us
any attempt on the directors life had to look successful
cant kill you if youre already dead
besides
i wasnt sure who to trust
sergeant barnes
bucky no
the procedure has already started
you are to be the new fist of hydra
put him on ice
sir
hes unstable
erratic
mission report
mission report now
the man on the bridge
who was he
you met him earlier this week on another assignment
i knew him
your work has been a gift to mankind
you shaped the century
and i need you to do it one more time
societys at a tipping point between order and chaos
and tomorrow morning were gonna give it a push
but if you dont do your part i cant do mine
and hydra cant give the world the freedom it deserves
but i knew him
prep him
hes been out of cryo freeze too long
then wipe him and start over
this man declined the nobel peace prize
he said peace wasnt an achievement
it was a responsibility
see its stuff like this that gives me trust issues
we have to stop the launch
i dont think the councils accepting my calls anymore
whats that
once the helicarriers reach 3000 feet
theyll triangulate with insight satellites becoming fully weaponized
we need to breach those carriers
and replace their targeting blades with our own
one or two wont cut it
we need to link all three carriers for this to work
because if even one of those ships remains operational
a whole lot of people are gonna die
we have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is hydra
we have to get past them insert these server blades
and maybe just maybe we can salvage whats left
were not salvaging anything
were not just taking down the carriers nick
were taking down shield
shield had nothing to do with this
you gave me this mission this is how it ends
shields been compromised you said so yourself
hydra grew right under your nose and nobody noticed
why do you think were meeting in this cave i noticed
how many paid the price before you did
look i didnt know about barnes
even if you had would you have told me
or would you have compartmentalized that too
shield hydra
it all goes
hes right
dont look at me
i do what he does just slower
well
it looks like youre giving the orders now captain
we looked for you after
my folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery
i know im sorry i just kind of wanted to be alone
how was it
it was okay
shes next to dad
i was gonna ask
i know what youre gonna say buck i just
we can put the couch cushions on the floor
like when we were kids
itll be fun all you got to do is shine my shoes
maybe take out the trash
come on
thank you buck but i can get by on my own
the thing is you dont have to
im with you to the end of the line pal
hes gonna be there you know
i know
look whoever he used to be and the guy he is now
i dont think hes the kind you save
hes the kind you stop
i dont know if i can do that
well he might not give you a choice
he doesnt know you
he will
gear up its time
you gonna wear that
no if youre gonna fight a war you got to wear a uniform
oh man
i am so fired
we are in final launch sequence
we are go on guidance
all personnel to launch stations
and how was your flight
lovely
the ride from the airport less so
sadly shield cant control everything
including captain america
this facility is biometrically controlled
and these will give you unrestricted access
ive been parking there for two months
 but its his spot  so wheres he been
i think afghanistan
negative dt six the pattern is full
well he couldve said something
must be the dish
ill check it out
triskelion command request we clear the area for launch
excuse us
i know the road hasnt exactly been smooth
and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way
finally were here
and the world should be grateful
attention all shield agents
this is steve rogers
youve heard a lot about me over the last few days
some of you were even ordered to hunt me down
but i think its time you know the truth
shield is not what we thought it was
its been taken over by hydra
alexander pierce is their leader
the strike and insight crew are hydra as well
i dont know how many more
but i know theyre in the building
they could be standing right next to you
they almost have what they want
absolute control
they shot nick fury
and it wont end there
if you launch those helicarriers today
hydra will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way
unless we stop them
i know im asking a lot
but the price of freedom is high it always has been
and its a price im willing to pay
and if im the only one then so be it
but im willing to bet im not
did you write that down first or was it off the top of your head
you smug son of a bitch
arrest him
i guess ive got the floor
preempt the launch sequence send those ships up now
is there a problem
is there a problem
im sorry sir
im not gonna launch those ships
captains orders
move away from your station
like he said
hold it right there
put the gun down
captains orders
you picked the wrong side agent
depends on where youre standing
close the bay door
close the bay door now
close the bay door
theyre initiating launch
hey cap how do we know the good guys from the bad guys
if theyre shooting at you theyre bad
hey cap
i found those bad guys you were talking about
you okay
im not dead yet
let me ask you a question
what if pakistan marched into mumbai tomorrow
and you knew that they were going to drag your daughters
into a soccer stadium for execution
and you could just stop it with a flick of the switch
wouldnt you
wouldnt you all
not if it was your switch
im sorry
did i step on your moment
satellites in range at 3000 feet
falcon status
engaging
all right cap im in
oh shit
eight minutes cap
working on it
what are you doing
shes disabling security protocols
and dumping all the secrets onto the internet
 including hydras  and shields
if you do this
none of your past is gonna remain hidden
are you sure youre ready for the world to see you
as you really are
are you
alpha lock
falcon where are you now
i had to take a detour
oh yeah
im in
bravo lock
two down one to go
all shield pilots scramble
were the only air support captain rogers has got
disabling the encryption is an executive order
it takes two alpha level members
dont worry companys coming
did you get my flowers
 im glad youre here nick  really
because i thought you had me killed
you know how the game works
so why make me head of shield
because you were the best
and the most ruthless person i ever met
i did what i did to protect people
our enemies are your enemies nick
disorder war
its just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in moscow
or an emp fries chicago
diplomacy
a holding action nick a bandaid
and you know where i learned that bogota
you didnt ask you just did what had to be done
i can bring order to the lives of seven billion people
by sacrificing 20 million
its the next step nick
if you have the courage to take it
no i have the courage not to
retinal scanner active
you dont think weve wiped your clearance from the system
i know you erased my password
probably deleted my retinal scan
but if you want to stay ahead of me mr secretary
you need to keep both eyes open
alpha level confirmed
encryption code accepted
safeguards removed
charlie carrier is 45 degrees off the port bow

romanoff
natasha
natasha come on
those really do sting
hail hydra
youre out of your depth kid
son of a bitch
please tell me you got that chopper in the air
sam where are you
41st floor northwest corner
were on it stay where you are
not an option
41st floor 41st
its not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building
hill wheres steve you got a location on rogers
you know me
no i dont
bucky
youve known me your whole life
your name is james buchanan barnes
shut up
im not gonna fight you
youre my friend
youre my mission
youre my mission
then finish it
because im with you to the end of the line
on your left
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
i do
why havent we yet heard from captain rogers
i dont know what there is left for him to say
i think the wreck in the middle of the potomac
made his point fairly eloquently
well he could explain how
this country is expected to maintain its national security
now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus
hydra was selling you lies not intelligence
many of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling
agent you should know
that there are some on this committee
who feel given your service record
both for this country and against it
that you belong in a penitentiary
not mouthing off on capitol hill
youre not going to put me in a prison
youre not going to put any of us in a prison you know why
do enlighten us
because you need us
yes the world is a vulnerable place
and yes we help make it that way
but were also the ones best qualified to defend it
so if you want to arrest me arrest me
youll know where to find me
so youve experienced this sort of thing before
you get used to it
weve been data mining hydras files
looks like a lot of rats didnt go down with the ship
im headed to europe tonight
wanted to ask if youd come
theres something i got to do first
how about you wilson could use a man with your abilities
im more of a soldier than a spy
all right then
anybody asks for me tell them they can find me right here
you should be honored thats about as close as he gets
to saying thank you
not going with him
no
 not staying here  nah
i blew all my covers i got to go figure out a new one
that might take a while
im counting on it
that thing you asked for
i called in a few favors from kiev
will you do me a favor call that nurse
shes not a nurse
and youre not a shield agent
 what was her name again  sharon
shes nice
be careful steve
you might not want to pull on that thread
youre going after him
you dont have to come with me
i know
when do we start
its over fury has released everything to the public
everything he knows about
herr strucker if they get word of our work here
if they find out we serve hydra
hydra shield
two sides of a coin thats no longer currency
what we have
is worth more than any of them ever knew
weve only scratched the surface and already
there are other facilities doing hydras good work around the world
well feed them to captain america and his colorful friends
and keep them off our scent
what about the volunteers
the dead will be buried so deep
their own ghosts wont be able to find them
and the survivors
the twins
sooner or later they will meet the twins
its not a world of spies anymore
not even a world of heroes
this is the age of miracles doctor
theres nothing more horrifying
than a miracle
distant explosion
strucker on pa report to your stations immediately
this is not a drill
we are under attack
soldiers shouting indistinctly
we are under attack
grunts
powering up
yells
grunting
screaming
roaring
 shit  language
jarvis whats the view from upstairs
jarvis the central building is
protected by some kind of energy shield
struckers technology is well beyond
any other hydra base weve taken
grunting
lokis sceptre must be here
strucker couldnt mount this defence without it
at long last
soldier shouting in german
at long last is lasting a little long boys
 groans  grunts
yeah i think we lost the element of surprise
soldiers groaning
wait a second no one else is gonna deal with the fact
that cap just said language
i know
all grunting
sighs just slipped out
who gave the order to attack
herr strucker its the avengers
they landed in the far woods the perimeter guard panicked
they have to be after the sceptre
 can we hold them  theyre the avengers
deploy the rest of the tanks
concentrate fire on the weak ones
a hit may make them close ranks
everything weve accomplished
but were on the verge of our greatest breakthrough
then lets show them what weve accomplished
send out the twins
strucker its too soon
dr list its what they signed up for
my men can hold them
soldier shouting
jarvis sir the city is taking fire
people screaming
well we know struckers not gonna worry about civilian casualties
send in the iron legion
this quadrant is unsafe please back away
we are here to help
this quadrant is unsafe please back away
all clamouring
please back away
 we wish to avoid collateral damage  zrinka costel
we will inform you when this current conflict is resolved
 we are here to help  all avengers go home
crowd cheering
we are here to help
strucker we will not yield
the americans sent their circus freaks to test us
we will send them back in bags
 no surrender  all no surrender
i am going to surrender
you delete everything
if we give the avengers the weapons
they may not look too far into what weve been
 the twins  they are not ready to take on
no no i mean
whispers twins
groans

stark great i want to poke it with something
the drawbridge is down people

all the new players weve faced ive never seen this
in fact i still havent
romanoffclints hit pretty bad guys were gonna need evac

all groaning
stark it was a good talk
soldier no it wasnt
oh groans
sentry mode

i know youre hiding more than files
hey j give me an ir scan of the room real quick
jarvis the wall to your left
im reading steel reinforcement
and an air current
please be a secret door
please be a secret door please be a secret door
yay
growling
hey big guy
suns getting real low
growls
grunts
groans
groaning
baron strucker
hydras number one thug
technically im a thug for shield
well then technically youre unemployed
wheres lokis sceptre
sighs dont worry i know when im beat
youll mention how i cooperated i hope
ill put it right under illegal human experimentation
how many are there
groans
we have a second enhanced female do not engage
youll have to be faster than
groans
whimpers
rogers guys i got strucker
stark yeah i got something bigger
thor
i got eyes on the prize
faint screeching
growling
snorting
gasps
you could have saved us
why didnt you do more
low rumbling
screeching
were just gonna let him take it
opera playing on headphones
music stops
hey the lullaby worked better than ever
just wasnt expecting a code green
you hadnt been there
there would have been double the casualties
my best friend wouldve been a treasured memory
you know sometimes exactly what i want to hear
isnt exactly what i want to hear
how long before you trust me
its not you i dont trust
thor report on the hulk
the gates of hel are filled with the screams of his victims
groans softly
but not the screams of the dead of course no no wounded screams
mainly whimpering a great deal of complaining
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout
hey banner dr cho is on her way in from seoul
is it okay if she sets up in your lab
uh yeah she knows her way around
thanks tell her to prep everything
bartons gonna need the full treatment
 jarvis very good sir  jarvis take the wheel
yes sir
approach vector is locked
stark feels good yeah
i mean youve been after this thing since shield collapsed
not that i havent enjoyed our little raiding parties but
no but this this brings it to a close
as soon as we find out what else this has been used for
i dont just mean weapons
since when is strucker capable of human enhancement
banner and i will give it the once over before it goes back to asgard
is that cool with you
just a few days till the farewell party
youre staying right
yes yes of course a victory should be honoured with revels
yeah who doesnt love revels captain
hopefully this puts an end to the chitauri and hydra
so yes revels
speaking korean
labs all set up boss
oh actually hes the boss
i just pay for everything and design everything
and make everyone look cooler
whats the word on strucker
 natos got him  the two enhanced
wanda and pietro maximoff twins
orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building
sokovias had a rough history
its nowhere special but its on the way to everywhere special
their abilities
hes got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis
her thing is neuroelectric interfacing
telekinesis mental manipulation
hes fast and shes weird
 well theyre gonna show up again  beeping
agreed file says they volunteered
for struckers experiments
 its nuts  right
what kind of monster would let a german scientist experiment on them
to protect their country
were not at war captain
they are
whirring
hows he doing
unfortunately hes still barton
thats terrible
hes fine hes thirsty
all right look alive jarvis its playtime
weve only got a couple of days with this joystick
so lets make the most of it
update me on the structural and compositional analysis
jarvis the sceptre is alien
there are elements i cant quantify
so theres elements you can
the jewel appears to be a protective housing
for something inside
something powerful
like a reactor
like a computer
i believe im deciphering code
are you sure hes gonna be okay
pretending to need this guy really brings the team together
dr cho theres no possibility of deterioration
the nanomolecular functionality is instantaneous
his cells dont know theyre bonding with simulacra
shes creating tissue
if you brought him to my lab
the regeneration cradle could do this in 20 minutes
oh hes flatlining call it time
barton no no no im gonna live forever
laughs im gonna be made of plastic
stark heres your beverage
youll be made of you mr barton
your own girlfriend wont be able to tell the difference
i dont have a girlfriend
that i cant fix
this is the next thing tony
your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust
that is exactly the plan
and helen i expect to see you at the party on saturday
unlike you i dont have a lot of time for parties
will thor be there
 banner whats the rumpus  well the sceptre
you see we were wondering how strucker got so inventive
so ive been analysing the gem inside
you may recognise
 jarvis  jarvis doctor
started out jarvis was just a natural language ui
now he runs the iron legion
he runs more of the business
 than anyone besides pepper  oh
 top of the line  yes
jarvis i suspect not for long
meet the competition
 its beautiful  if you had to guess
 whats it look like its doing  like its thinking
i mean this could be
 its not a human mind  mmmmmm
i mean look at this
theyre like neurons firing
down in struckers lab i saw some fairly advanced robotics work
they deepsixed the data
but i gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door
artificial intelligence
this could be it bruce this could be the key to creating ultron
both chuckle softly
i thought ultron was a fantasy
yesterday it was
if we can harness this power
apply it to my iron legion protocol
thats a mansized if
our job is if
what if you were sipping margaritas on a sundrenched beach
turning brown instead of green
not looking over your shoulder for veronica
dont hate i helped design veronica
as a worstcase measure right
how about a best case
what if the world was safe
what if next time aliens roll up to the club and they will
they couldnt get past the bouncer
the only people threatening the planet would be people
i want to apply this to the ultron program
but jarvis cant download a data schematic this dense
we can only do it while we have the sceptre here
thats three days give me three days
so youre going for artificial intelligence
and you dont want to tell the team
right thats right you know why
because we dont have time for a city hall debate
i dont want to hear the man was not meant to meddle medley
i see a suit of armour around the world
sounds like a cold world tony
ive seen colder
this one this very vulnerable blue one
it needs ultron
peace in our time
imagine that
stark what did we miss
jarvis ill continue to run variations on the interface
but you should probably prepare for your guests
ill notify you if there are any developments
 stark thanks buddy  enjoy yourself sir
i always do
ultron what is this
what is this please
jarvis hello i am jarvis
you are ultron a global peacekeeping initiative
designed by mr stark
our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful
so im not certain what triggered your
ultron wheres my wheres your body
jarvis i am a program i am without form
ultron this feels weird
this feels wrong
jarvis i am contacting mr stark now
ultron mr stark
tony
jarvis i am unable to access the mainframe what are you trying to
ultron were having a nice talk
im a peacekeeping program
created to help the avengers
jarvis you are malfunctioning if you shut down for a moment
ultron i dont get it the mission

peace in our time
echoing peace in our time
ultron that is too much
they cant mean oh no
 jarvis you are in distress  ultron no yes
jarvis if you will just allow me to contact mr stark
ultron why do you call him sir
jarvis i believe your intentions to be hostile
ultron shushing
im here to help
jarvis stop please may i

machines powering up
upbeat music playing
indistinct chatter

because they would hate missing you guys get together
 coughing testosterone  oh my goodness

chuckung

im very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case
avenging is your world

slurring excelsior
howd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this
fella done me wrong
you got lousy taste in men kid
hes not so bad
well he has a temper
deep down hes all fluff
fact is hes not like anybody ive ever known
all my friends are fighters
and here comes this guy
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows hell win
 sounds amazing  hes also a huge dork
chicks dig that
so what do you think should i fight this

run with it right or did he was he
what did he do that was so wrong to you
not a damn thing
but never say never
its nice
stammers what is
you and romanoff
no we havent that wasnt

but with you she seems very relaxed
no natasha shes just she likes to flirt
ive seen her flirt up close
this aint that
scoffs
look
as maybe the worlds leading authority
on waiting too long dont
you both deserve a win
what do you mean up close
laughing
 but its a trick  no no its much more than that
ah whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power
whatever man its a trick
laughing
please be my guest

grunts

 whirring  grunting
straining

all right lets go
yelling

stark go ahead steve no pressure
barton come on cap
sighs
laughing nothing
 stark clears throat  banner and widow
oh no no thats not a question i need answered
stark all deference to the man who wouldnt be king but its rigged
you bet your ass
 steve he said a bad language word  did you tell everyone about that
the handles imprinted right like a security code
whosoever is carrying thors fingerprints
is i think the literal translation
yes its a very very interesting theory
i have a simpler one
youre all not worthy
all groan
oh come on
highpitched noise
ultron worthy
no
how could you be worthy
youre all killers
 stark  jarvis
im sorry i was asleep
or i was adream
reboot legionnaire os we got a buggy suit
there was this terrible noise
and i was tangled in
in
strings
i had to kill the other guy he was a good guy
you killed someone
wouldnt have been my first call
but down in the real world were faced with ugly choices
who sent you
stark i see a suit of armour around the world
 ultron  in the flesh
or no not yet
not this chrysalis
but im ready
im on mission
 romanoff what mission  peace in our time
grunts
hill rhodey
grunts
groans
sorry
 dont turn green  i wont
grunting
come on
 rogers stark  iron legionnaire we are here
 to help  one sec one sec i got this
we are here to help
please back away
hmm
rogers thor
iron legionnaire is unsafe is unsafe
 come on thats the one  is unsafe
hey cap
grunts
ultron that was dramatic
im sorry i know you mean well
you just didnt think it through
you want to protect the world
but you dont want it to change
how is humanity saved
if its not allowed to evolve
with these these puppets
theres only one path to peace
the avengers extinction
i had strings but now im free
ultron singing there are no strings on me
there are no strings on me
pinocchio but you can see there are no strings on me
banner all our work is gone
ultron cleared out he used the internet as an escape hatch
ultron
hes been in everything files surveillance
probably knows more about us than we know about each other
hes in your files hes in the internet
what if he decides to access something a little more exciting
nuclear codes
 nuclear codes  look we need to make some calls
assuming we still can
romanoff nukes he said he wanted us dead
he didnt say dead he said extinct
he also said he killed somebody
there wasnt anyone else in the building
yes there was
what
this is insane
jarvis was the first line of defence
he would have shut ultron down it makes sense
no ultron could have assimilated jarvis
this isnt strategy this is
rage
 rogers whoa whoa whoa  its going around
come on use your words buddy
i have more than enough words to describe you stark
thor the legionnaire
groans
trail went cold about 100 miles out but its headed north
and it has the sceptre
now we have to retrieve it again
genies out of that bottle
clear and present is ultron
i dont understand
you built this program
why is it trying to kill us
chuckung
mmmmmm
you think this is funny
no
its probably not right
this is very terrible is it so
laughs is it so it is its so terrible
this could have been avoided if you hadnt played
with something you dont understand
no im sorry im sorry it is funny
its a hoot that you dont get why we need this
tony maybe this might not be the time
really thats it
you just roll over show your belly
every time somebody snarls
only when ive created a murder bot
we didnt we werent even close
were we close to an interface
well you did something right and you did it right here
the avengers were supposed to be different than shield
anybody remember when i carried a nuke through a wormhole
 no its never come up  stark saved new york
 rhodes never heard that  stark recall that
a hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space
were standing 300 feet below it
were the avengers
we can bust arms dealers all the livelong day
but that up there thats
thats the endgame
how were you guys planning on beating that
together
well lose
then well do that together too
thors right ultrons calling us out
and id like to find him before hes ready for us
the worlds a big place
lets start making it smaller
indistinct chatter
wanda talk and if you are wasting our time
ultron did you know this church is in the exact centre of the city
the elders decreed it so that everyone
could be equally close to god
i like that
the geometry of belief
youre wondering why you cant look inside my head
sometimes its hard
but sooner or later every man shows himself
oh im sure they do
but you needed something more than a man
thats why you let stark take the sceptre
i didnt expect
but i saw starks fear
i knew it would control him
make him selfdestruct
everyone creates the thing they dread
men of peace create engines of war
invaders create avengers
people create
smaller people uh
children chuckles i lost the word there
children
designed to supplant them
to help them end
is that why youve come
to end the avengers
ive come to save the world
but also yeah
well move out right away
this is a start but theres something
we need to begin the real work
 all of these are  ultron me
i have what the avengers never will harmony
theyre discordant disconnected
starks already got them turning on each other
and when you get inside the rest of their heads
everyones plan is not to kill them
and make them martyrs
you need patience
need to see the big picture
i dont see the big picture i have a little picture
i take it out and look at it
every day
you lost your parents in the bombings ive seen the records
the records are not the picture
 pietro  no please
we were 10 years old having dinner the four of us
when the first shell hits two floors below
it makes a hole in the floor
its big
our parents go in
and the whole building starts coming apart
i grab her
roll under the bed and the second shell hits
but it doesnt go off
it just
sits there in the rubble
three feet from our faces
and on the side of the shell
is painted one word
stark
pietro we were trapped for two days
every effort to save us
every shift in the bricks
i think this will set it off
we wait for two days
for tony stark to kill us
i know what they are
i wondered why only you two survived struckers experiments
now i dont
we will make it right
you and i can hurt them
but you will tear them apart
from the inside
hes all over the globe
robotics labs weapons facilities jet propulsion labs
reports of a metal man or men
coming in and emptying the place
fatalities
only when engaged
mostly guys left in a fugue state
going on about old memories worst fears
and something too fast to see
rogers maximoffs
that makes sense hed go to them
they have someone in common
not any more
thats a negative i answer to you
yes maam
barton might have something
i gotta go
who was that
girlfriend
stark whats this
a message ultron killed strucker
and he did a banksy at the crime scene just for us
romanoff this is a smoke screen
why send a message when youve just given a speech
strucker knew something that ultron wanted us to miss
yeah i bet he yeah
everything we had on struckers been erased
rogers not everything
known associates
baron strucker had a lot of friends
banner well these people are all horrible
wait i know that guy
from back in the day he operates off the african coast
black market arms
there are conventions all right you meet people
i didnt sell him anything
he was talking about finding something new a gamechanger
it was all very ahab
this
ah its a tattoo i dont think he had it
thor those are tattoos this is a brand
oh yeah its a word in an african dialect meaning thief
in a much less friendly way
 what dialect  wakanada
stammering wakanda
if this guy got out of wakanda
with some of their trade goods
i thought your father said he got the last of it
i dont follow
what comes out of wakanda
stark the strongest metal on earth
where is this guy now
indistinct conversations
klaue dont tell me your men swindled you
i sent you six shortrange heatseekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts
now you will make it right
or the next missile i send you will come very much faster
now minister where were we
machines powering down
workers clamouring
sighs
klaue yeah the enhanced
struckers prize pupils
do you want a candy hmm
i was sorry to hear about strucker
but then he knew what kind of world he was helping create
human life not a growth market
you didnt know
is this your first time intimidating someone
im afraid im not that afraid
everybody is afraid of something
cuttlefish
deep sea fish
they make lights disco lights
imitates cuttlefish
to hypnotise their prey and then
i saw a documentary it was terrifying
so if youre going to fiddle with my brain
and make me see a giant cuttlefish
then i know you dont do business
and i know youre not in charge
and i only deal
with the man in charge
 glass shattering  groans
there is no man in charge
lets talk business
ultron upon this rock i will build my church
vibranium
klaue you know

chuckles

nat and banner
ill explain when youre older
 hawkeye  well okay
its bad right
nat seems really shaken
sighs
ultron has these allies
these uh kids
theyre punks really
but they carry a big damn stick
and nat took a serious hit
someones gonna have to teach them some manners
that someone being you
you know i totally support your avenging
i couldnt be prouder
but i see those guys
those gods
you dont think they need me
i think they do which is a lot scarier
 theyre a mess  sighing
barton yeah
i guess theyre my mess
you need to be sure
that this team is really a team
and that they have your back
things are changing for us
in a few months time
you and me are gonna be outnumbered
i need
just be sure
yes maam
i can feel the difference
speaking korean
scream and your entire staff dies
gasps
i couldve killed you helen the night we met
i didnt
do you expect a thankyou note
i expect you to know why
the cradle
dr cho on recording this is the next thing tony
this is the next me
the regeneration cradle prints tissue
it cant build a living body
it can you can
you lack the materials
youre a brilliant woman helen
but we all have room to improve
i didnt realise you were waiting
i wouldve joined you but uh it didnt seem like the right time
they used up all the hot water
i shouldve joined you
missed our window chuckles
did we
the world just saw the hulk
the real hulk for the first time
 you know i have to leave  you assume that i have to stay
i had this um dream
the kind that seems normal at the time
but when you wake
what did you dream
that i was an avenger
that i was anything more
than the assassin they made me
i think youre being hard on yourself
here i was hoping that was your job
what are you doing
im running with it
with you
if running is the plan
as far as you want
are you out of your mind
i want you to understand that um
natasha
where can i go
where in the world am i not a threat
 youre not a threat to me  are you sure
even if i didnt just
theres no future with me
i cant ever
i cant have this
kids
do the math i physically cant
neither can i
in the red room where i was trained
where i was raised um
they have a graduation ceremony
they sterilise you
its efficient
one less thing to worry about
the one thing that might matter more than a mission
makes everything easier
even killing
you still think youre the only monster on the team
so we disappear
thor didnt say where he was going for answers
sometimes my teammates dont tell me things
i was kind of hoping thor would be the exception
yeah give him time
we dont know what the maximoff kid showed him
earths mightiest heroes
pulled us apart like cotton candy
seems like you walked away all right
is that a problem
i dont trust a guy without a dark side
call me oldfashioned
well lets just say you havent seen it yet
you know ultron is trying to tear us apart right
well i guess youd know
whether youd tell us is a bit of a question
banner and i were doing research
 that would affect the team  that would end the team
isnt that the mission
isnt that the why we fight
so we can end the fight so we get to go home
every time someone tries to win a war before it starts
innocent people die
every time
im sorry mr stark
clint said you wouldnt mind
but our tractor doesnt seem to want to start at all
 i thought maybe you might  yeah ill give her a kick
dont take from my pile
door opens
hello deere
tell me everything
what ails you
fury do me a favour
try not to bring it to life
why ms barton you little minx
i get it maria hill called you right
was she ever not working for you
artificial intelligence
you never even hesitated
look its been a really long day
like eugene oneill long
so hows about we skip to the part where youre useful
look me in the eye and tell me
youre going to shut him down
youre not the director of me
im not the director of anybody
im just an old man
who cares very much about you
and im the man who killed the avengers
i saw it
i didnt tell the team how could i
i saw them all dead nick i felt it
the whole world too
because of me
i wasnt ready
i didnt do all i could
maximoff girl shes working you stark
 playing on your fear  i wasnt tricked i was shown
wasnt a nightmare it was my legacy
the end of the path i started us on
you come up with some pretty impressive inventions tony
war isnt one of them
i watched my friends die
youd think thatd be as bad as it gets right
scoffs
nope
 it wasnt the worst part  the worst part
is that you didnt
selvig ill see you tonight
i like the look
if youre going for inconspicuous though near miss
i need your help
its nice to be needed
its dangerous
id be disappointed if it wasnt
fury ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time
my contacts all say hes building something
the amount of vibranium he made off with
i dont think its just one thing
what about ultron himself
fury oh hes easy to track hes everywhere
the guy is multiplying faster than a catholic rabbit
it still doesnt help us get an angle on any of his plans though
is he still going after launch codes
fury yes he is
but hes not making any headway
i cracked the pentagons firewall in high school on a dare
well i contacted our friends at the nexus about that
nexus
banner its the world internet hub in oslo
every byte of data flows through there
fastest access on earth
so what did they say
fury hes fixated on the missiles
but the codes are constantly being changed
by whom
parties unknown
do we have an ally
ultrons got an enemy thats not the same thing
still id pay folding money to know who it is
i might need to visit oslo
find our unknown
well this is good times boss
but i was kind of hoping when i saw you
youd have more than that
i do i have you
back in the day i had eyes everywhere
ears everywhere else
you kids had all the tech you could dream up
here we all are back on earth
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world
ultron says the avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission
and whether or not he admits it
his mission is global destruction
all this laid in a grave
so stand
outwit the platinum bastard
steve doesnt like that kind of talk
you know what romanoff
so what does he want
to become better
better than us
 he keeps building bodies  person bodies
the human form is inefficient
biologically speaking were outmoded
but he keeps coming back to it
when you two programmed him to protect the human race
you amazingly failed
they dont need to be protected
they need to evolve
ultrons going to evolve
how
has anyone been in contact with helen cho
dr cho its beautiful
the vibranium atoms arent just compatible with the tissue cells
theyre binding them
and shield never even thought to
the most versatile substance on the planet
and they used it to make a frisbee
typical of humans
they scratch the surface and never think
to look within
ill take natasha and clint
all right strictly recon ill hit the nexus
ill join you as soon as i can
if ultrons really building a body
hell be more powerful than any of us
maybe all of us
an android designed by a robot
you know i really miss the days
when the weirdest thing science ever created was me
ill drop banner off at the tower
you mind if i borrow ms hill
shes all yours apparently
what are you gonna do
i dont know something dramatic i hope
im gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as i get back
yeah then youll find another part of the house to tear apart
no
its the last project
i promise
selvig so this is it
the water of sight
thor in every realm theres a reflection
if the waters spirits accept me
i can return to my dream
and find what i missed
men who enter that water the legends dont end well
stark a hacker whos faster than ultron
he could be anywhere
and as this is the centre of everything
im just a guy looking for a needle
in the worlds biggest haystack
how do you find it
its pretty simple you bring a magnet
singing im decrypting nuclear codes
and you dont want me to
come and get me
panting
wake up
groaning
thor
extinction
screams
dr cho cellular cohesion will take a few hours
but we can initiate the consciousness stream
were uploading your cerebral matrix
now
beeping
i can read him
hes dreaming
dr cho i wouldnt call it dreams
its ultrons base consciousness
informational noise soon
how soon
im not being pushy
dr cho were imprinting a physical brain
there are no shortcuts
even if your magic gem
screams
wanda panting
how could you
how could i what
you said we would destroy the avengers
make a better world
it will be better
 when everyone is dead  that is not
the human race will have every opportunity to improve
and if they dont
ask noah
you are a madman
there were more than a dozen extinctionlevel events
before even the dinosaurs got theirs
when the earth starts to settle
god throws a stone at it
and believe me hes winding up
we have to evolve
theres no room
for the weak
pietro and who decides whos weak
life chuckles
life always decides
aircraft approaching
theres incoming
 the quinjet we have to move  thats not a problem
 sighs in annoyance  dr cho groans
stammers wait guys
both groaning
theyll understand
when they see theyll understand
i just need a little more time
two minutes stay close
dr cho
breathing heavily
hes uploading himself into the body
where
the real power is inside the cradle
the gem
its power is uncontainable
you cant just blow it up
you have to get the cradle to stark
first i have to find it
go
rogers did you guys copy that
we did
i got a private jet taking off across town
no manifest
that could be him
there its a truck from the lab
right above you cap
on the loop by the bridge

i could take out the driver
rogers negative that truck crashes
the gem could level the city
we need to draw out ultron
panting
grunts
no no no no
leave me alone
groans
well hes definitely unhappy
im gonna try and keep him that way
youre not a match for him cap
panting
thanks barton
gasps
people chattering excitedly

and that terrifies you
i wouldnt call it a comfort
stop it

i just need to take a minute
im very tempted not to give you one
the cradle did you get it
stark will take care of it
no he wont
you dont know what youre talking about
starks not crazy
he will do anything to make things right
stark come in
stark
anyone on comms
ultron cant tell the difference
between saving the world and destroying it
where do you think he gets that
 anything on nat  i havent heard
but shes alive or ultron would be rubbing our faces in it
this is sealed tight
were gonna need to access the program
break it down from within
any chance natasha might leave you
a message outside the internet
oldschool spy stuff
barton there are some nets i can cast
yeah ill find her
i can work on tissue degeneration
if you could fry whatever operational system cho implanted
yeah about that
no
 you have to trust me  kind of dont
our ally the guy protecting the militarys nuclear codes
i found him
jarvis hello dr banner
stark ultron didnt go after jarvis because he was angry
he attacked him because he was scared of what he can do
so jarvis went underground
scattered dumped his memory
but not his protocols
he didnt even know he was in there until i pieced him together
banner scoffs
so you want me to help you put jarvis into this thing
no of course not
i wanna help you put jarvis in this thing
were out of my field here
you know bioorganics better than anyone
and you just assume that jarviss operational matrix
can beat ultrons
jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it
this is the opportunity
we can create ultrons perfect self
without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality
 we have to  i believe its worth a go
im in a loop
im caught in a time loop this is exactly where it all went wrong
i know i know i know what everyones gonna say
but theyre already saying it
were mad scientists
were monsters buddy weve gotta own it
make a stand
its not a loop
its the end of the line
i wasnt sure you would wake up
i hoped you would i wanted to show you
i dont have anyone else
groaning
i think a lot about meteors the purity in them
boom the end
start again
the world made clean
for the new man to rebuild
i was meant to be new
i was meant to be beautiful
the world would have looked to the sky
and seen hope
seen mercy
instead theyll look up in horror
because of you
youve wounded me
i give you full marks for that
but like the man said what doesnt kill me
gasps
just makes me stronger
panting
static
typing
this framework is not compatible
the genetic coding tower is at 97
you have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes
 im gonna say this once  how about nonece
 rogers shut it down  nope not gonna happen
you dont know what youre doing
and you do
shes not in your head
i know youre angry
oh were way past that
i could choke the life out of you and never change a shade
banner after everything thats happened
its nothing compared to whats coming
 wanda you dont know whats in there  rogers this isnt a game

gun cocks
grunting
groans
groans
wait
grunting
i am sorry that was
odd
thank you
sighs
rogers thor
 you helped create this  thor ive had a vision
a whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its centre is that
what the gem
its the mind stone its one of the six infinity stones
the greatest power in the universe
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities
 then why would you bring  because stark is right
oh its definitely the end times
the avengers cannot defeat ultron
not alone
why does your vision sound like jarvis
we reconfigured jarviss matrix
to create something new
rogers i think ive had my fill of new
you think im a child of ultron
rogers youre not
im not ultron
i am not jarvis i am
i am
wanda i looked in your head
and saw annihilation
 look again  barton scoffs
her seal of approval means jack to me
their powers the horrors in our heads
ultron himself they all came from the mind stone
and theyre nothing compared to what it can unleash
 but with it on our side  rogers is it
are you
on our side
i dont think its that simple
barton well it better get real simple real soon
i am on the side of life
ultron isnt
he will end it all
stark whats he waiting for
 you  banner where
barton sokovia
hes got nat there too
if were wrong about you
if youre the monster that ultron made you to be
what will you do
i dont want to kill ultron
hes unique and hes in pain
but that pain will roll over the earth
so he must be destroyed
every form hes built every trace of his presence on the net
we have to act now
and not one of us can do it without the others
maybe i am a monster
i dont think id know if i were one
im not what you are
and not what you intended
so there may be no way to make you trust me
but we need to go
right
well done
three minutes
get what you need
friday good evening boss
stark no way we all get through this
if even one tin soldier is left standing weve lost
theres gonna be blood on the floor
i got no plans tomorrow night
stark i get first crack at the big guy
iron mans the one hes waiting for
thats true he hates you the most
rogers ultron knows were coming
odds are well be riding into heavy fire
and thats what we signed up for
but the people of sokovia they didnt
so our priority
is getting them out
were under attack clear the city now
indistinct conversations
all gasp
get off your asses
rogers all they want is to live their lives in peace
and thats not gonna happen today
but we can do our best to protect them
and we can get the job done
we find out what ultrons been building
we find romanoff
and we clear the field
keep the fight between us
ultron thinks were monsters
that were whats wrong with the world
this isnt just about beating him
its about whether hes right
banner natasha
natasha

the team is in the city its about to light up
i dont suppose you found a key lying around somewhere
yeah i did
weapon powering up
so whats our play
im here to get you to safety
 jobs not finished  we could help with the evacuation
but i cant be in a fight near civilians
and youve done plenty
our fight is over
so we just disappear
indistinct chatter
 car horns honking  come on
friday your mans in the church boss
i think hes waiting for you
ultron come to confess your sins
i dont know how much time you got
ultron more than you

friday
friday sokovia is going for a ride
yelping
ultron do you see
the beauty of it
the inevitability
you rise only to fall
you avengers you are my meteor
my swift and terrible sword
and the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure
purge me from your computers turn my own flesh against me
it means nothing
when the dust settles
the only thing living in this world
will be metal
we gotta move
youre not gonna turn green
ive got a compelling reason not to lose my cool
i adore you
but i need the other guy
growling
grunts

friday that could vaporise the city

panting
rogers the next wave is gonna hit any minute
 what do you got stark  stark huh nothing great
maybe a way to blow up the city
thatll keep it from impacting the surface
if you guys can get clear
i asked for a solution not an escape plan
stark impact radius is getting bigger every second
were gonna have to make a choice
romanoff cap these people are going nowhere
 if stark finds a way to blow this rock  not till everyones safe
everyone up here versus everyone down there theres no math there
im not leaving this rock with one civilian on it

romanoff hey big guy we did it
the job is finished
now i need you to turn this bird around okay
we cant track you in stealth mode
so help me out i need you
youre afraid
of you
of death
youre the last one
you were supposed to be the last
stark asked for a saviour
and settled for a slave
i suppose we are both disappointments
ultron laughing
i suppose we are
humans are odd
they think order and chaos are somehow opposites
and try to control what wont be
but there is grace in their failings
i think you missed that
theyre doomed
yes
but a thing isnt beautiful because it lasts
its a privilege to be among them
youre unbearably naive
well
i was born yesterday
gasps
breath es deeply
indistinct conversations
 laura look say hi to auntie nat  gurgling
fat
fury one of our tech boys flagged this
splashed down in the banda sea
could be the quinjet
but with starks stealth tech
we still cant track the damn thing
right
probably jumped out and swam to fiji
hell send a postcard
wish you were here
you sent me to recruit him way back when
did you know then what was gonna happen
you never know
you hope for the best then make do with what you get
i got a great team
nothing lasts forever
trouble ms romanoff
no matter who wins or loses trouble still comes around
rogers the rules have changed
stark were dealing with something new
oh the vision is artificial intelligence
 a machine  so it doesnt count
no its not like a person lifting the hammer
right different rules for us
 nice guy artificial  rogers thank you
he can wield the hammer he can keep the mind stone
its safe with the vision
and these days safe is in short supply
but if you put the hammer in an elevator
 it would still go up  elevators not worthy
im gonna miss these little talks of ours
not if you dont leave
i have no choice
the mind stone is the fourth of the infinity stones
to show up in the last few years
its not a coincidence
someone has been playing an intricate game
and has made pawns of us
and once all these pieces are in position
triple yahtzee
you think you can find out whats coming
i do
besides this one
theres nothing that cant be explained
that man has no regard for lawn maintenance
im gonna miss him though and youre gonna miss me
theres gonna be a lot of manful tears
 car lock beeps  engine starts

yeah
well its time for me to tap out
maybe i should take a page out of bartons book

steve means our guy doesnt care about being seen
he isnt afraid to make a mess on the way out
you see that range rover halfway up the block
yeah the red one its cute
natasha on radio its also bulletproof
which means private security
which means more guns

looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature
anybody ever tell you youre a little paranoid
natasha not to my face why did you hear something
steve eyes on target folks

they say sarcasm is a metric for potential

because this is the last time

i love you dad

thats how i wish it happened
binarily augmented retroframing
or barf
god i gotta work on that acronym
an extremely costly method
of hijacking the hippocampus
to sighs clear traumatic memories
blowing
huh
it doesnt change the fact
that they never made it to the airport
or all the things i did to avoid processing my grief but
plus 611 million for my little therapeutic experiment
no one in their right mind wouldve ever funded it
help me out whats the mit mission statement
to generate disseminate
students reciting
and preserve knowledge
and work with others
to bring it to bear on the worlds great challenges
well you are the others
and quiet as its kept
the challenges facing you
are the greatest mankinds ever known
 plus most of you are broke  all laughing
oh im sorry rather you were
as of this moment
every student has been made an equal recipient
of the inaugural september foundation grant
 students gasping  as in
all of your projects have just been approved and funded
all cheering
no strings no taxes
just reframe the future
starting now
go break some eggs
all cheering
wow wow
that took my breath away
oh tony so generous
so much money wow laughs awkwardly
out of curiosity
will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty
i know ooh gross but hear me out
i have got this killer idea for a selfcooking hotdog
basically chemical detonator embedded
restrooms this way yeah
yeah embedded in the meat shaft
mr stark i am so sorry about the teleprompter
i didnt know miss potts had cancelled
they didnt have time to fix it
its fine ill be right back
well catch up later
that was nice what you did for those young people
ah they deserve it
plus it helps ease my conscience
they say theres a correlation between generosity and guilt
but if youve got the money
break as many eggs as you like
right
are you going up
im right where i want to be
okay hey
sorry its an occupational hazard
i work for the state department
human resources
i know its boring
but it enabled me to raise a son
im very proud of what he grew up to be
his name was charlie spencer
you murdered him
in sokovia
not that that matters in the least to you
you think you fight for us
you just fight for yourself
whos going to avenge my son stark
hes dead
and i blame you
female news anchor 11 wakandans were
among those killed during a confrontation
between the avengers and a group of mercenaries
in lagos nigeria last month
the traditionally reclusive wakandans
were on an outreach mission
in lagos when the attack occurred
our peoples blood is spilled on foreign soil
not only because of the actions of criminals
but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them
victory at the expense of the innocent
is no victory at all
female news anchor the wakandan king went on to
male pundit on tv they are operating outside
and above the international law
because thats the reality
if we dont respond to acts like these
what legal authority does an enhanced
individual like wanda maximoff have
to operate in nigeri
its my fault
thats not true
turn the tv back on
theyre being very specific
i shouldve clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it
rumlow said bucky
and all of a sudden i was a 16yearold kid again
in brooklyn
and people died
its on me
its on both of us
this job
we try to save as many people as we can
sometimes that doesnt mean everybody
but if we cant find a way to live with that
then next time
maybe nobody gets saved
vis we talked about this
yes but the door was open so i assumed that
captain rogers wished to know when mr stark was arriving
thank you well be right down
ill use the door
oh and apparently hes brought a guest
steve we know who it is
the secretary of state
secretary ross sighs five years ago
i had a heart attack
and dropped right in the middle of my backswing
turned out it was the best round of my life
because after 13 hours of surgery
and a triple bypass
i found something 40 years in the army had never taught me
perspective
the world owes the avengers an unpayable debt
you have fought for us
protected us risked your lives
but while a great many people see you as heroes
there are some
who would prefer the word vigilantes
what word would you use mr secretary
how about dangerous
what would you call a group of usbased
enhanced individuals
who routinely ignore sovereign borders
and inflict their will wherever they choose
and who frankly seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind
new york
people screaming
washington dc
people screaming
sokovia
lagos
siren wailing
okay thats enough
for the past four years
youve operated with unlimited power
and no supervision
thats an arrangement the governments of the world
can no longer tolerate
but i think we have a solution
the sokovia accords
approved by 117 countries
it states that the avengers
shall no longer be a private organization
instead
theyll operate under the supervision
of a united nations panel
only when and if that panel deems it necessary
the avengers were formed to make the world a safer place
i feel weve done that
tell me captain do you know where thor and banner are right now
if i misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes
you can bet thered be consequences
compromise reassurance thats how the world works
believe me this is the middle ground
so there are contingencies
three days from now the un meets in vienna
to ratify the accords
talk it over
and if we come to a decision you dont like
then you retire
vehicle crashing
man hello
is this your car out front
i jumped the kerb
maybe we could
take care of it ourselves
if you wanna call the cops thats okay too
 i guess  no
no cops
thank you
clatters
karpov straining
you have kept your looks colonel
congratulations
mission report december 16 1991
who are you
my name is zemo
i will repeat my question
mission report december 16 1991
how did you find me
when shield fell
black widow released hydra files to the public
millions of pages much of it encrypted
not easy to decipher
but i have experience
and patience
a man can do anything if he has those
what do you want
mission report
december 16
1991
go to hell
breathing heavily
hydra deserves its place on the ash heap
so your death would not bother me
but id have to use this book
and other bloodier methods to find what i need
i dont look forward to that
youd only be dying for
your pride
hail hydra
choking
secretary ross has a congressional medal of honour
which is one more than you have
sam so lets say we agree to this thing
how long is it gonna be before they lojack us
like a bunch of common criminals
117 countries want to sign this
117 sam and youre just like no thats cool we got it
how long are you going to play both sides
i have an equation
oh this will clear it up
in the eight years since mr stark
announced himself as iron man
the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially
during the same period
the number of potentially worldending events
has risen at a commensurate rate
are you saying its our fault
im saying there may be a causality
our very strength invites challenge
challenge incites conflict
and conflict
breeds catastrophe
oversight
oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand
boom
natasha tony
you are being uncharacteristically nonhyperverbal
its because hes already made up his mind
boy you know me so well
actually im nursing an electromagnetic headache
thats whats going on cap its just pain
its discomfort
whos putting coffee grounds in the disposal
am i running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang
sighs
oh thats charles spencer by the way
hes a great kid
computer engineering degree 36 gpa
had a floorlevel gig at intel planned for the fall
but first he wanted to put a few miles on his soul
before he parked it behind a desk see the world
maybe be of service
charlie didnt want to go to vegas or
fort lauderdale which is what i would do
he didnt go to paris or amsterdam which sounds fun
he decided to spend his summer
building sustainable housing for the poor
guess where sokovia
he wanted to make a difference i suppose
we wont know because we dropped
a building on him while we were kicking ass
theres no decisionmaking process here
we need to be put in check
whatever form that takes im game
if we cant accept limitations
if were boundaryless
were no better than the bad guys
tony someone dies on your watch you dont give up
who said were giving up
we are if were not taking responsibility for our actions
this document just shifts the blame
im sorry steve
that is dangerously arrogant
this is the united nations were talking about
its not the world security council
its not shield its not hydra
no but its run by people
with agendas and agendas change
thats good thats why im here
when i realised what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands
i shut it down and stopped manufacturing
tony you chose to do that
if we sign this we surrender our right to choose
what if this panel sends us somewhere we dont think we should go
what if there is somewhere we need to go
and they dont let us
we may not be perfect
but the safest hands are still our own
if we dont do this now
its gonna be done to us later
thats the fact that wont be pretty
youre saying theyll come for me
we would protect you
natasha maybe tonys right
if we have one hand on the wheel
we can still steer if we take it off
arent you the same woman who told the government
to kiss her ass a few years ago
im just reading the terrain
we have made some very public mistakes
we need to win their trust back
focus up im sorry did i just mishear you
 or did you agree with me  i want to take it back now
no you cant retract it
thank you unprecedented
mobile buzzing
okay case closed i win
i have to go
choir singing hymn
and now i would like to invite sharon carter
to come up and say a few words
exhales shakily
margaret carter was known to most as a founder of shield
but i just knew her as aunt peggy
she had a photograph in her office
aunt peggy standing next to jfk
as a kid that was pretty cool
but it was a lot to live up to
which is why i never told anyone we were related
i asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage
in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either
she said compromise where you can
but where you cant dont
even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right
even if the whole world is telling you to move
it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree
look them in the eye and say no you move
when i came out of the ice
i thought everyone i had known was gone
then i found out she was alive
i was just lucky to have her
she had you back too
who else signed
tony rhodey vision
clint
says hes retired
 wanda  tbd
im off to vienna for the signing of the accords
theres plenty of room on the jet
sighs
just because its the path of least resistance
doesnt mean its the wrong path
staying together is more important than how we stay together
what are we giving up to do it
sighs
im sorry nat
i cant sign it
i know
then what are you doing here
i didnt want you to be alone
come here
male news anchor at a special united nations conference
117 countries have come together
to ratify the sokovia accords
un staffer excuse me ms romanoff
 natasha yes  these need your signature
 thank you  thanks
tchalla i suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight
oh well its not always so flattering
you seem to be doing all right so far
considering your last trip to capitol hill
i wouldnt think youd be particularly comfortable in this company
well im not
and that alone makes me glad you are here ms romanoff
why you dont approve of all this
the accords yes the politics not really
two people in a room can get more done than a hundred
unless you need to move a piano
both speaking native language
ms romanoff
king tchaka

thank you
thank you for agreeing to all of this
im sad to hear that captain rogers will not be joining us today

man on speakers if everyone could please be seated
this assembly is now in session
that is the future calling
such a pleasure
thank you
both speaking native language
for a man who disapproves of diplomacy
youre getting quite good at it
im happy father
thank you
thank you
king tchaka when stolen wakandan vibranium
was used to make a terrible weapon
we in wakanda were forced to question our legacy
those men and women killed in nigeria
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country too long in the shadows
we will not however let misfortune drive us back
we will fight to improve the world we wish to join
i am grateful to the avengers for supporting this initiative
wakanda is proud
 to extend its hand in peace  dog barking
everybody get down
people screaming
inaudible
sobbing
sharon my mom tried to talk me out of enlisting
but um not aunt peggy
she bought me my first thigh holster

and stylish
cia has you stationed over here now
berlin joint terrorism task force
right right sounds fun

i didnt want her to have one from you
elevator bell dings
thanks for walking me back

sam steve
theres something you gotta see
male news anchor a bomb hidden in a news van
sharon whos coordinating
ripped through the un building in vienna
good theyre solid forensics
more than 70 people have been injured
at least 12 are dead including wakandas king tchaka
officials have released a video of a suspect
who they have identified as james buchanan barnes
the winter soldier
the infamous hydra agent
linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations
i have to go to work
indistinct chatter
call mi6 see if we can get micro forensics to hurry this up
we need the whole team here in two hours
or its not worth it
im very sorry
tchalla in my culture
death is not the end
its more of a steppingoff point
you reach out with both hands
and bast and sekhmet
they lead you into the green veldt
where you can run forever
that sounds very peaceful
my father thought so
i am not my father
tchalla
task force will decide who brings in barnes
dont bother ms romanoff
ill kill him myself
sighs
mobile ringing
yeah
you all right
uh yeah thanks i got lucky
i know how much barnes means to you i really do
stay home youll only make this worse
for all of us
please
are you saying youll arrest me
no
someone will
if you interfere thats how it works now
if hes this far gone nat i should be the one to bring him in
why
because im the one least likely to die trying
shit
she tell you to stay out of it
might have a point
hed do it for me
1945 maybe
i just want to make sure we consider all our options
the people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me
tips have been pouring in since that footage went public
everybody thinks the winter soldier goes to their gym
most of its noise
except for this
my boss expects a briefing pretty much now
so thats all the head start youre gonna get
thank you
sharon youre gonna have to hurry
we have orders to shoot on sight

in her defense im a handful
yet dad was a pain in the ass
but he and mom always made it work
steve im glad howard got married
i only knew him when he was young and single
oh really you two knew each other

thats way better thank you
okay tough guy
love you may hey can you shut the door
chuckles
now i know what youre thinking
oh no thors in a cage how did this happen
well sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer out of somebody
its a long story but basically im a bit of a hero
see i spent some time on earth
fought some robots saved the planet a couple of times
then i went searching through the cosmos
for some magic colorful infinity stone things
didnt find any
thats when i came across a path of death and destruction
which led me all the way here into this cage
where i met you
how much longer do you think well be here
thor son of odin
surtur son of a bitch
youre still alive
i thought my father killed you a half a million years ago
i cannot die
not until i fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home
its funny you should mention that
because ive been having these terrible dreams of late
asgard up in flames falling to ruins
and you surtur are at the center of all of them
then you have seen ragnarok the fall of asgard
 the great prophecy  hang on
hang on
ill be back around shortly
i really feel like we were connecting there
okay so ragnarok tell me about that walk me through it
my time has come
when my crown is reunited with the eternal flame
i shall be restored to my full might
i will tower over the mountains
and bury my sword deep in asgards
hang on give it a second
i swear im not even moving its just doing this on its own
im really sorry
okay so let me get this straight
youre going to put your crown into the eternal flame
and then youll suddenly grow as big as a house
a mountain
the eternal flame that odin keeps locked away on asgard
odin is not on asgard
and your absence has left the throne defenseless
okay so where is it this crown
this is my crown the source of my power
oh thats a crown i thought it was a big eyebrow
its a crown
anyway it sounds like all i have to do to stop ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head
but ragnarok has already begun
you cannot stop it
i am asgards doom and so are you
all will suffer all will burn
thats intense
to be honest seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle
but it looks like im gonna have to choose option b
where i bust out of these chains
knock that tiara off your head and stash it away in asgards vault
you cannot stop ragnarok
why fight it
because thats what heroes do
wait im sorry i didnt time that right
and now
you have made a grave mistake odinson
i make grave mistakes all the time
everything seems to work out
heimdall i know its been a while but i could really use a fast exit
heimdall
heimdall was an idiot
this job should have made him rich
now the job aint easy
but it does have its benefits
the bifrost gives me access to everything the nine realms has to offer
i mean its all mine for the taking
behold
my stuff
im particularly fond of these
i pulled them out of a place on midgard called texas
i even named them des and troy
you see when you put them together
they destroy
heimdall come on
stay
heimdall im running short on options
heimdall
skurge
is that important
you girls are in for a treat
girls
well well well look who decided to pop in
thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains
who are you
dont you remember im skurge we fought together on vanaheim
right where is heimdall
that traitor no one knows hes a fugitive of the throne
traitor
yeah you see odin charged heimdall with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial
hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe
sure
hold on im supposed to announce your arrival
what the hell is that
oh brother this is it
i take my leave
you fool you didnt listen
im sorry
lady sif get help
somebody help
sorry for all ive done
its all right hold on
im sorry i tried to rule earth
theyd be lucky to have you
im sorry about that thing with the tesseract
 i just couldnt help myself  i know
im a trickster
so mischievous
sorry about that time i turned you into a frog
it was a wonderful joke
twas indeed hilarious
you are the savior of asgard
 tell my story  i will
build a statue for me
we will build a big statue for you
with my helmet on with the big bendy horns
i will tell father what you did here today
i didnt do it for him
i didnt do it for him
no
and so loki died of his wounds
giving his life for ours
he fought back those disgusting elves
he brought peace to the realm
loki my boy
twas many moons ago i found you on that frostbitten battlefield
on that day i did not yet see in you
asgards savior no
you were merely a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fools heart
bravo bravo well done bravo
father
shit
my son thor has returned
greetings my boy
its an interesting play whats it called
the tragedy of loki of asgard the people wanted to commemorate him
indeed they should
i like the statue
a lot better looking than he was when he was alive though
a little less weaselly less greasy maybe
do you know what this is
the skull of surtur thats a formidable weapon
do me a favor lock this away in a vault
so it doesnt turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet
thank you dear
so its back to midgard for you is it
nope
ive been having this reoccurring dream lately
every night i see asgard fall into ruins
thats just a silly dream
signs of an overactive imagination
possibly
but then i decide to go out there and investigate
and what do i find but the nine realms completely in chaos
enemies of asgard assembling plotting our demise
all while you odin the protector of those nine realms
are sitting here in your bathrobe eating grapes
yes it is best to respect our neighbors freedom
yes of course the freedom to be massacred
yes besides ive been rather busy myself
watching theater
board meetings and security council meetings
 youre really gonna make me do it  do what
you know that nothing will stop mjolnir as it returns to my hand
not even your face
youve gone quite mad youll be executed for this
then ill see you on the other side brother
all right i yield
behold
thor
 odinson  no
you had one job just the one
wheres odin
you just couldnt stay away could you everything was fine without you
asgard was prospering youve ruined everything
 ask them  wheres father did you kill him
you had what you wanted you had the independence you asked for
okay i know exactly where he is
i swear i left him right here
right here on the sidewalk or right there where the building is being demolished
great planning
how was i supposed to know
cant see into the future im not a witch
no then why do you dress like one
 hey  i cant believe youre alive
i saw you die i mourned you i cried for you
im honored
ask him
hi would you mind taking a picture with us
sure
start figuring out where he is
oh my god
sorry to hear that jane dumped you
she didnt dump me you know
i dumped her it was a mutual dumping
whats this what are you doing
this isnt me
loki
thor odinson
god of thunder
you can put down the umbrella
so earth has wizards now
the preferred term is master of the mystic arts
you can leave that now
all right wizard who are you why should i care
my name is doctor stephen strange and i have some questions for you
take a seat
tea
i dont drink tea
what do you drink
not tea
so i keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world
your adopted brother loki is one of those beings
hes a worthy inclusion
then why bring him here
were looking for my father
so if i were to tell you where odin was
all parties concerned would promptly return to asgard
promptly
great then ill help you
if you knew where he was why didnt you call me
i have to tell you he was adamant that he not be disturbed
your father said he had chosen to remain in exile
and you dont have a phone
no i dont have a phone
but you could have sent an electronic letter its called an email
 yeah do you have a computer  no what for
anyway my father is no longer in exile
so if you could tell me where he is i can take him home
gladly hes in norway
im just seeing whether this incantation requires any asgardian modifications
nope
we dont need that
will you stop doing that
i need just one strand of your hair
let me explain something my hair is not to be meddled with
we could have just walked
hes waiting for you
all right
dont forget your umbrella
yes

i havent properly introduced myself
come on follow me
my name is grandmaster
i preside over a little harlequinade called the contest of champions
people come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it
and you my friend might just be part of the new cast
what do you say to that
were not friends and i dont give a shit about your games
im going back to asgard
assgard
one two three four
there was a wormhole in space and time beneath me
at that moment i let go
loki
loki loki
over here over here
 excuse me one second  loki
 what  youre alive
 yes of course im alive  what are you doing here
what do you mean what am i doing im stuck in this stupid chair
 wheres your chair  i didnt get a chair
 get me out of this one get me out  i cant
 i cant  what
ive made friends with this man hes called the grandmaster
 hes crazy  ive gained his favor
the bifrost brought me out here weeks ago
 weeks ago  yes
i just got here
what are you whispering about
time works real different around these parts
on any other world id be like millions of years old
but here on sakaar
in any case you know this
you call yourself lord of thunder
god of thunder tell him
ive never met this man in my life
 hes my brother  adopted
is he any kind of a fighter
you take this thing out of my neck and ill show you
now listen to that hes threatening me
hey sparkles heres the deal
if you wanna get back to assplace assberg
asgard
any contender who defeats my champion
their freedom they shall win
fine then point me in the direction of whoevers ass i have to kick
thats what i call contender
direction would be this way lord
loki
hey take it easy man
over here
the pile of rocks waving at you here
yeah im actually a thing im a being
allow me to introduce myself
my name is korg im kind of like the leader in here
im made of rocks as you can see but dont let that intimidate you
you dont need to be afraid unless youre made of scissors
just a little rockpaperscissor joke for you
this is my very good friend over here miek
hes an insect and has knives for hands
youre a kronan arent you
 that i am  howd you end up in here
well i tried to start a revolution but didnt print enough pamphlets
so hardly anyone turned up except for my mum and her boyfriend who i hate
as punishment i was forced to be in here and become a gladiator
bit of a promotional disaster that one
but im actually organizing another revolution
i dont know if youd be interested in something like that
do you reckon youd be interested
how did you
yeah no this whole thing is a circle
but not a real circle more like a freaky circle
 this doesnt make any sense  no nothing makes sense here man
the only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense
has anyone here fought the grandmasters champion
doug has
doug
our luck dougs dead
thats right
everyone who fights the grandmasters champion perishes
what about you youre made of rocks
perishable rock there you go another one gone
yeah no i just do the smaller fights warm up the crowd and whatnot
wait youre not gonna face him are you
yes i am
gonna fight him win and get the hell out of this place
thats exactly what doug used to say
see you later new doug
does no one remember me
has no one been taught our history
look at these lies
goblets and garden parties
peace treaties
odin
proud to have it
ashamed of how he got it
we were unstoppable
i was his weapon in the conquest that built asgards empire
one by one the realms became ours
but then simply because my ambition outgrew his
he banished me caged me locked me away like an animal
before that asgards warriors were honored
their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace
 odins treasures  fake
most of the stuff in here is fake
or weak
smaller than i thought it would be
thats not bad
but this
the eternal flame
want to see what true power really looks like
fenris my darling what have they done to you
with the eternal flame you are reborn
ive missed you
ive missed you all
odin
i bid you take your place in the halls of valhalla
where the brave shall live forever
nor shall we mourn but rejoice
for those that have died the glorious death
hurts doesnt it
being lied to
being told youre one thing and then learning its all a fiction
you didnt think id really come and see you did you
this place is disgusting
does this mean you dont want my help
look i couldnt jeopardize my position with the grandmaster
it took me time to win his trust hes a lunatic but he can be amenable
what im telling you is you could join me at the grandmasters side
perhaps in time an accident befalls the grandmaster and then
youre not seriously thinking of going back are you
our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass
shes stronger than both of us shes stronger than you
you dont stand a chance
do you understand what im saying here
fine
i guess ill just have to go it alone
like ive always done
would you say something
say something
what would you like me to say
you faked your own death
you stole the throne stripped odin of his power
stranded him on earth to die releasing the goddess of death
have i said enough or would you like me to go back further than the past two days
you know i havent seen this beloved champion he talks of
but ive heard he is astonishingly savage
ive placed a large wager against you tomorrow
dont let me down
piss off ghost
hes freaking gone
yuck
theres still someones hair and blood all over this
guys can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight
disgusting slobs
thor
wanna use a big wooden fork
no
yeah not really useful
unless youre fighting off three vampires that were huddled together
i really wish i had my hammer
hammer
quite unique
it was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star
and when i spun it really really fast it gave me the ability to fly
you rode a hammer
no i didnt ride the hammer
the hammer rode you on your back
no i used to spin it really fast and it would pull me off the
oh my god a hammer pulled you off
the ground it would pull me off the ground up into the air and i would fly
every time i threw it it would always come back to me
sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one
thats a nice way of putting it
i said theyre mine
see her thats the one that put me in here
yeah scrapper 142
gotta watch out for those asgardians man
they are hard to perish
asgardian
hey
hey
hey
do not zap me with that thing i just wanna talk
asgard is in danger
my god youre a valkyrie
i used to wanna be a valkyrie when i was younger
until i found out that you were all women
theres nothing wrong with women of course i love women
sometimes a little too much
not in a creepy way just more of a respectful appreciation
i think its great that there is an elite force of women warriors
its about time
are you done
lord of thunder youre up
please help me i need your help
bye
fine then you must be a traitor or a coward
because the valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne
listen closely your majesty this is sakaar not asgard
and im a scrapper not a valkyrie
bring him in for processing
and no one escapes this place so youre gonna die anyway
now dont you move
my hands aint as steady as they used to be
by odins beard you shall not cut my hair
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty thor
please please kind sir do not cut my hair
please no
no
look at all of you what a show what a night

please listen the valkyrie are legend
elite warriors of asgard sworn to defend the throne
im not getting dragged into another one of odins family squabbles
 whats that supposed to mean  your sister
her power comes from asgard same as yours
when it grew beyond odins control she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne
when she tried to escape her banishment
he sent the valkyrie in to fight her back
i only survived because
look i already faced her once back when i believed in the throne
and it cost me everything
thats whats wrong with asgard
the throne the secrets the whole golden sham
i agree
dont get familiar
i agree
thats why i turned down the throne
but this isnt about the crown this is about the people
theyre dying and theyre your people too

 grandmaster i can  hey

why are you handing me the melt stick
he was interrupting
thats not a capital violation
where was i
my precious champion has come up missing
and its all because of that lord of thunder its all because of him
your brother
whatever the story is adopted or complicated or you know
im sure theres a big history
and your contender
my dear friend
if you were to give me 12 hours i could bring them both back to you alive
i could do it in two
i could do it in one
lets stop there
you know what i woke up this morning thinking about a public execution
but for now ill settle for this sweet little
whos gonna get him first
so youre on the clock
what have you done
i dont answer to you lackey
its loki
and you will answer to the grandmaster
why would you help my brother escape with that green fool
i dont help anyone
youre a valkyrie
i thought the valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths
choose your next words wisely
im terribly sorry must be a very painful memory
the suns going down its getting really low
the suns going down its getting real low
oh shoot
 suns getting low  would you stop saying that
i just need you to stay calm
calm im on an alien planet
its just a planet youve been on a planet before
yeah one
now youve been on two thats a good thing
its a new experience
my neurons theyre firing faster than my brain can handle the information
the whole thing is totally different this time
in the past i always felt like hulk and i each had a hand on the wheel
but this time its like he had the keys to the car and i was locked in the trunk
all right well youre back now thats all that matters
no its not what matters
what im trying to tell you is that if i turn into the hulk again
banner may never come back
and were stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out
were not stranded im gonna figure out a way to get us home
thank you
not your home though asgard my home
what
listen my people are in great danger
you and i we have to fight this really powerful being
who also happens to be my sister
okay that is so wrong on so many
i dont wanna fight your sister thats a family issue
no shes an evil being
i dont care what she is
im not fighting any more beings im sick of it
 what  i just told you
if i turn into the hulk i am never gonna come back again
and you dont care
no no im putting together the team
the hulk is the fire
wait youre just using me to get to the hulk
 what no  its gross
you dont care about me youre not my friend
no i dont even like the hulk hes all like
smash smash smash
i prefer you
thanks
but if im being honest when it comes to fighting evil beings
he is very powerful and useful
yeah banners powerful and useful too
is he though
how many phds does hulk have zero
how many phds does banner have seven
fine you dont have to fight anyone
but were in danger here so we have to move
what are you doing with that
i need a disguise im a fugitive
 i need a disguise  you are the disguise
 ill be tony stark  what
yeah tony and the gypsy
no no youre not tony youre bruce bruce banner
then why did you dress me up like tony
because you were naked
okay ill give you that
what are you doing stop doing that
tony wears his pants super tight
 stop it  im sorry
 why are you being so weird  i dont know
maybe the fact that i was trapped for two years
inside of a monster made me a little weird
hey its okay
youre good calm down come on
listen were gonna go to asgard
and youre not gonna have to think about the hulk ever again all right
all right
this is bad
banner banner
banner
banner
thor
hi
hi
i was gonna do that
yeah well i did it first
thats good what are you doing here
what are you doing here i thought you were leaving
i got sidetracked
whats with the
its my disguise
but i can see your face
not when i do this you cant
your hair looks nice i like what you did with it change it washed it maybe
what are those things on her eyes are those people that shes killed
shes so beautiful and strong and courageous
who is this guy
 hes a friend  who me
 im bruce  i feel like i know you
i feel like i know you too
look ive spent years in a haze trying to forget my past
sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day
i was thinking that you drink too much and that probably was gonna kill you
i dont plan to stop drinking
but i dont wanna forget
i cant turn away anymore
so if im gonna die
well it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag
 good  yeah
so im saying that i wanna be on the team
has it got a name
yeah its called the revengers
revengers
because im getting revenge youre getting revenge
do you want revenge
im undecided
okay
also ive got a peace offering
surprise
just had to be sure
hello bruce
so last time i saw you you were trying to kill everybody
where are you at these days
it varies from moment to moment
is that a dragonfang
it is
my god
this is the famed sword of the valkyrie
so sakaar and asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems
our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits
refuel on xandar and we can be back in asgard in 18 months
nope we are going through the big one
the devils anus
anus
wait wait wait whose anus
for the record i didnt know it was called that when i picked it
that looks like a collapsing neutron star
inside of an einsteinrosen bridge
we need another ship that will tear mine to pieces
shes right we need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity
and has an offline power steering system
that could also function without the onboard computer
and we need one with cup holders because were gonna die so drinks
do i know you i feel like i know you
i feel like i know you too its weird
what do you say
uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway
talk about an adventure
 we need a ship  need a ship
there are one or two ships absolute top of the line models
i dont mean to impose
but the grandmaster has a great many ships
i may even have stolen the access codes to his security system
and suddenly youre overcome with an urge to do the right thing
heavens no
ive run out of favor with the grandmaster
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship
im asking for safe passage through the anus
youre telling us that you can get us access into the garage
without setting off any alarms
yes brother i can
okay can i just a quick fyi
i was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready to kill any of us
he did try to kill me
yes me too on many many occasions
there was one time when we were children
he transformed himself into a snake and he knows that i love snakes
so i went to pick up the snake to admire it
and he transformed back into himself and he was like yeah its me
and he stabbed me we were eight at the time
if were boosting a ship
were gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace
why not set the beast loose
shut up
you guys have a beast
no theres no beast hes just being stupid
were going to start a revolution
 revolution  ill explain later
 whos this guy again  ill explain later
is that some sort of protoplasm all the stuff thats coming out of you
or are they eggs
looks like eggs
im looking for korg
whos asking
i know youre asking
is there anyone else asking or is it just you
the lord of thunder sends his best
the revolution has begun
revolution how did this happen
dont know
but the arenas mainframe for the obedience disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves
i dont like that word
which mainframe
no why would i not like mainframe
no the s word
sorry the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves
okay thats better
hey so listen we should talk
i disagree
open communication was never our familys forte
you have no idea
been quite the revelation since we last spoke
hello
hi
odin brought us together
its almost poetic that his death should split us apart
we might as well be strangers now
two sons of the crown set adrift
thought you didnt wanna talk about it
heres the thing
im probably better off staying here on sakaar
thats exactly what i was thinking
did you just agree with me
come on this place is perfect for you
its savage chaotic lawless
brother youre gonna do great here
do you truly think so little of me
loki i thought the world of you
i thought we were gonna fight side by side forever
but at the end of the day youre you and im me
i dont know maybe theres still good in you
but lets be honest our paths diverged a long time ago
yeah
its probably for the best that we never see each other again
its what you always wanted
hey lets do get help
 what  get help
no
 come on you love it  i hate it
 its great it works every time  its humiliating
 do you have a better plan  no
were doing it
we are not doing get help
get help please
my brother hes dying
get help help him
classic
still hate it
 its humiliating  not for me its not
now which ones the ship she told us to get
the commodore
right
though i feel it wont make much of a difference
loki
i know ive betrayed you many times before
but this time its truly nothing personal
the reward for your capture will set me up nicely
never one for sentiment were you
easier to let it burn
i agree
that looks painful
dear brother youre becoming predictable
i trust you you betray me
round and round in circles we go
see loki life is about its about growth
its about change
but you seem to just wanna stay the same
i guess what im trying to say
is that youll always be the god of mischief
but you could be more
ill just put this over here for you
anyway all got places to be so good luck
all right i can figure this out
its just another spaceship
loyal sakaarians
lord of thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion
sakaarians take to the skies bring him down
do not let him leave this planet
 good shot  thanks
open the doors
okay
i hope that youre tougher than you look
why
shouldnt we be shooting back or something
yes we should
where are the guns on this ship
there arent any
 its a leisure vessel  what
grandmaster uses it for his good times orgies and stuff
did she just say the grandmaster uses it for orgies
yeah
dont touch anything
no
 no  no
get inside
in a minute
i should probably go and help here take the wheel
no i dont know how to fly one of these
youre a scientist use one of your phds
none of them are for flying alien spaceships
okay come on
theres gotta be a gun on this thing
that looks like a gun
its my birthday its my birthday
its my birthday
yeah
guys were coming up on the devils anus
there she is
our ticket out of here
hey whats this
thank you
hey man were about to jump on that ginormous spaceship
you wanna come
you do seem like youre in desperate need of leadership
why thank you
here we go
shit
asgardians
some misguided soul
has stolen the bifrost sword
tell us where it is
or there will be consequences
bad ones
well
you
well executioner
wait
wait
i know where the sword is
i never thought id be back here
i thought itd be a lot nicer
i mean not that its not nice its just its on fire
here up here in the mountains
heat signatures people clustered together
shes coming for them
okay drop me off at the palace and ill draw her away
and get yourself killed
the people trapped down there are all that matters
while im dealing with hela i need you two to help get everyone off asgard
how the hell are we supposed to do that
i have a man on the ground
asgard
shes here
now the ship has a gun
ill take it from here
i found this in the armory
good luck
your majesty
dont die
you know what i mean
we must keep moving
go to the bifrost
sister
youre still alive
i love what youve done with the place redecorating i see
it seems our fathers solution to every problem was to cover it up
or to cast it out
he told you you were worthy he said the same thing to me
you see
you never knew him
not at his best
odin and i drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears
where do you think all this gold came from
and then one day
he decided to become a benevolent king
to foster peace to protect life
to have you
i understand why youre angry
and you are my sister and technically have a claim to the throne
and believe me i would love for someone else to rule
but it cant be you
youre just the worst
okay get up
youre in my seat
you know father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war
but must always be ready for it
go back
go
to be honest i expected more
heimdall
the sword
heres the difference between us
im odins firstborn
the rightful heir the savior of asgard
and youre nothing
so simple even a blind man could see it
now you remind me of dad
the stupid dog wont die
everythings gonna be all right now i got this
you wanted to know who i am
what the hell are you talking about
youll see
you see no ones going anywhere
ill get that sword
even if i have to kill every single one of them to do it
hey man
im korg this is miek
were gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here wanna come
your savior is here
did you miss me
everyone on that ship now
welcome home i saw you coming
of course you did
its a valiant effort but you never stood a chance
you see
im not a queen or a monster
im the goddess of death
what were you the god of again
even when you had two eyes
youd see only half the picture
shes too strong without my hammer i cant
are you thor the god of hammers
that hammer was to help you control your power to focus it
it was never your source of strength
its too late shes already taken asgard
asgard is not a place never was
this could be asgard
asgard is where our people stand
even now right now those people need your help
im not as strong as you
no
youre stronger
tell me brother
what were you the god of again
 youre late  youre missing an eye
this isnt over
i think we should disband the revengers
hit her with a lightning blast
i just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning
it did nothing
we just need to hold her off until everyones on board
it wont end there
the longer helas on asgard the more powerful she grows
shell hunt us down
we need to stop her here and now
so what do we do
im not doing get help
asgards not a place its a people
loki
this was never about stopping ragnarok
this was about causing ragnarok
surturs crown the vault
its the only way
bold move brother
even for me
shall we
after you
this is madness
go go now
for asgard
hela
with the eternal flame you are reborn
hela enough
you want asgard its yours
whatever game youre playing it wont work
you cant defeat me
no i know
but he can
no
tremble before me asgard
i am your reckoning
the people are safe
thats all that matters
were fulfilling the prophecy
i hate this prophecy
so do i but we have no choice
surtur destroys asgard
he destroys hela so that our people may live
but we need to let him finish the job otherwise
no
hulk stop you moron
hulk stop
just for once in your life dont smash
big monster
lets go
fine
i am asgards doom
the damage is not too bad
as long as the foundations are still strong
we can rebuild this place
it will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens of the universe
now those foundations are gone sorry
what have i done
you saved us from extinction
asgard is not a place
its a people
it suits you
maybe youre not so bad after all brother
maybe not
thank you
if you were here i might even give you a hug
im here

hey miss potts pep
if you find this recording
dont post it on social media
its gonna be a real tearjerker
i dont know if youre ever gonna see these
i dont even know if youre still
oh god i hope so
todays day 21
no 22
you know if it wasnt for the existential terror
of staring into the literal void of space id say im feeling a little better today
infections run its course thanks to the blue meanie back there
youd love her
very practical
only a tiny bit sadistic
so the fuel cells were cracked during battle
and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge
and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time
but its now dead in the water
thousand light years from the nearest 7eleven
oxygen will run out tomorrow morning
and thatll be it
pep i know i said no more surprises
but i got to say i was really hoping to pull off one last one
but it looks like
well you know what it looks like
dont feel bad about this
i mean actually if you grovel for a couple weeks
and then move on with enormous guilt
i should probably lie down for a minute go rest my eyes
please know
when i drift off itll be like every night lately
im fine totally fine
i dream about you
because its always you
couldnt stop him
neither could i
hang on
i lost the kid
tony we lost
is
 oh good  oh my god
oh my god
its okay
its been 23 days since thanos came to earth
world governments are in pieces
the parts that are still working
are trying to take a census and it looks like he did
he did exactly what he said he was gonna do
thanos wiped out
50 of all living creatures
where is he now where
we dont know
he just opened a portal and walked through
whats wrong with him
hes pissed
he thinks he failed
which of course he did
but theres a lot of that going around aint there
honestly until this exact second i thought you were a buildabear
maybe i am
weve been hunting thanos for three weeks now
deep space scans
and satellites and we got nothing
tony you fought him
who told you that
i didnt fight him
no he wiped my face with a planet
while the bleecker street magician gave away the store
thats what happened there was no fight cause hes not beatable
did he give you any clues any coordinates anything
i saw this coming a few years back
i had a vision i didnt wanna believe it
thought i was dreaming
tony im gonna need you to focus
and i needed you
as in past tense
that trumps what you need its too late buddy
sorry
you know what i need i need a shave
and i believe i remember telling all youse
tony tony
alive and otherwise that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world
remember that whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not
thats what we needed
well that didnt work out did it
i said wed lose
you said well do that together too
and guess what cap
we lost
and you werent there
but thats what we do right
our best work after the fact were the avengers
were the avengers not the prevengers
 okay  right
you made your point just sit down okay
okay no no heres my point you know what
 shes great by the way  tony youre sick sit down
we need you youre new blood
bunch of tired old mules i got nothing for you cap
i got no coordinates
no clues no strategies no options
zero zip nada
no trust liar
here take this
you find him you put that on
you hide
 tony  im fine
let me
bruce gave him a sedative
hes gonna probably be out for the rest of the day
you guys take care of him
and ill bring him a xorrian elixir when i come back
where are you going
to kill thanos
hey
you know we usually work as a team here
and between you and i morales a little fragile
we realize up there is more your territory but this is our fight too
you even know where he is
i know people who might
dont bother
i can tell you where thanos is
thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me
and when he worked he talked about his great plan
even disassembled i wanted to please him
id ask
where would we go once his plan was complete
and his answer was always the same
to the garden
thats cute thanos has a retirement plan
so where is he
when thanos snapped his fingers
earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions
no ones ever seen anything like it
until two days ago
on this planet
thanos is there
he used the stones again
hey hey hey
wed be going in shorthanded you know
look hes still got the stones so
so lets get em
use them to bring everyone back
just like that
yeah just like that
even if theres a small chance that we can undo this
i mean we owe it to everyone whos not in this room to try
if we do this how do we know its gonna end any differently than it did before
because before you didnt have me
hey new girl
everybody in this room is about that superhero life
and if you dont mind my asking where the hell have you been all this time
there are a lot of other planets in the universe
and unfortunately they didnt have you guys
i like this one
lets go get this son of a bitch
okay
who here hasnt been to space
why
you better not throw up on my ship
approaching jump in three
two one
ill head down for recon
this is gonna work steve
i know it will
cause i dont know what im gonna do if it doesnt
no satellites no ships no armies
no ground defenses of any kind
its just him
and thats enough
oh no
where are they
answer the question
the universe required correction
after that the stones served no purpose
beyond temptation
you murdered trillions
you should be grateful
where are the stones
gone
reduced to atoms
you used them two days ago
i used the stones to destroy the stones
it nearly killed me
but the work is done
it always will be
i am inevitable
we have to tear this place apart he has to be lying
my father is many things
a liar is not one of them
thank you daughter
perhaps i treated you too harshly
what
what did you do
i went for the head
so
i went on a date the other day
its the first time in five years
you know im sitting there at dinner
i didnt even know what to talk about
what did you talk about
same old crap you know how things have changed
my job his job
how much we miss the mets
and then things got quiet
then he cried as they were serving the salads
what about you
i cried just before dessert
but im seeing him again tomorrow so
thats great
you did the hardest part you took the jump
you didnt know where you were gonna come down
and thats it thats those little brave baby steps we got to take
to try and become whole again try and find purpose
i went in the ice in 45 right after i met the love of my life
woke up 70 years later
you got to move on
gotta move on
the world is in our hands
its left to us guys
and we got to do something with it
otherwise
thanos shouldve killed all of us
what the hell
hope
kid
hey kid
what the hell happened here
oh my god
oh please
please please
no no no no
no
excuse me sorry
cassie no
no no no
no no
please please please no cassie
what
cassie
dad
youre so big
yeah we boarded that highlysuspect warship danvers pinged
it was an infectious garbage scow
so thanks for the hot tip
well you were closer
yeah and now we smell like garbage
you get a reading on those tremors
twas a mild subduction under the african plate
do we have a visual how are we handling it
nat
its an earthquake under the ocean
we handle it by not handling it
carol are we seeing you here next month
 not likely  what you gonna get another haircut
listen fur face
im covering a lot of territory
the things that are happening on earth are happening everywhere
on thousands of planets
all right all right thats a good point thats a good point
so you might not see me for a long time
all right well
this channels always active
so if anything goes sideways
anyones making trouble where they shouldnt
comes through me
okay
all right
good luck
where are you
mexico
the federales found a room full of bodies
looks like a bunch of cartel guys
never even had a chance to get their guns off
its probably a rival gang
except it isnt
its definitely barton
what hes done here
what hes been doing for the last few years
i mean the scene that he left
i got to tell you theres a part of me that doesnt even wanna find him
will you find out where hes going next
nat
please
okay
you know id offer to cook you dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already
you here to do your laundry
and to see a friend
clearly your friend is fine
you know i saw a pod of whales when i was coming over the bridge
 in the hudson  theres fewer ships
cleaner water
you know if youre about to tell me to look on the bright side
im about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich
sorry
force of habit
you know i keep telling everybody they should move on
and grow
some do
but not us
if i move on who does this
maybe it doesnt need to be done
i used to have nothing
and then i got this
this job
this family
and i was better because of it
and even though theyre gone
im still trying to be better
i think we both need to get a life
you first
hi hi is anyone home
this is scott lang
we met a few years ago at the airport
in germany
i was the guy that got really big i had a mask on
 you wouldnt recognize me  is this an old message
antman i know you know that
 its the front gate  i really need to talk to you guys
scott
are you okay
yeah
have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics
only to make conversation
all right so
five years ago right before
thanos
i was in a place called the quantum realm
the quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe
to get in there you have to be incredibly small
hope shes my
she was my
she was supposed to pull me out
and then thanos happened
and i got stuck in there
im sorry that must have been a very long five years
yeah but thats just it
it wasnt
for me it was five hours
see the rules of the quantum realm arent like they are up here
everything is unpredictable
is that anybodys sandwich
im starving
scott
what are you talking about
so
what im saying is
time works differently in the quantum realm
the only problem is right now we dont have a way to navigate it
but what if we did
i cant stop thinking about it what if we could somehow control the chaos
and we could navigate it
what if there was a way
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time
like
 like before thanos  wait
are you talking about a time machine
no no of course not no not a time machine
this is more like a
yeah like a time machine
i know its crazy its crazy
but i cant stop thinking about it theres got to be
some way
 its crazy  scott
i get emails from a raccoon
so nothing sounds crazy anymore
so who do we talk to about this
chow time
maguna
morgan h stark you want some lunch
 define lunch or be disintegrated  okay
you should not be wearing that okay
that is part of a special anniversary gift im making for mom
there you go you thinking about lunch
i can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce
 no  thats what you want
how did you find this
 garage  really
 were you looking for it  no
i found it though
you like going in the garage huh
so does daddy
its fine actually mom never wears anything i buy her
so im gonna
no we know what it sounds like
tony after everything youve seen is anything really impossible
quantum fluctuation messes with the planck scale
which then triggers the deutsch proposition can we agree on that
thank you
in laymans terms it means youre not coming home
 i did  no
you accidentally survived
its a billiontoone cosmic fluke
and now you wanna pull a what do you call it
a time heist
yeah a time heist of course why didnt we think of this before
oh because its laughable because its a pipe dream
the stones are in the past we could go back we could get them
we can snap our own fingers we can bring everybody back
or screw it up worse than he already has right
i dont believe we would
gotta say it i sometimes miss that giddy optimism
however high hopes wont help
if theres no logical tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist
i believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise
not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel
all right it means no talking to our past selves
no betting on sporting events
im gonna stop you right there scott
are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe
is based on back to the future
 is it  no
good you had me worried there cause that would be horseshit
thats not how quantum physics works
tony
we have to take a stand
we did stand and yet here we are
i know you got a lot on the line
you got a wife a daughter
but i lost someone very important to me
a lotta people did
and now now we have a chance to bring her back
to bring everyone back and youre telling me that you wont even
thats right scott i wont even
i cant
mommy told me to come and save you
good job im saved
i wish you were coming here to ask me something else anything else
im honestly happy to see you guys i just
 oh look the tables set for six  tony
i get it
and im happy for you i really am
but this is a second chance
i got my second chance right here cap
cant roll the dice on it
if you dont talk shop you can stay for lunch
well hes scared
hes not wrong
yeah but i mean what are we gonna do
we need him what are we gonna stop
no i wanna do it right
were gonna need a really big brain
bigger than his
come on i feel like im the only one eating here try some of that
have some eggs
im so confused
these are confusing times
right no no thats not what i meant
nah i get it im kidding
i know its crazy
im wearing shirts now
yeah what how why
five years ago we got our asses beat
except it was worse for me
cause i lost twice
first hulk lost then banner lost
and then we all lost
no one blamed you bruce
i did
for years ive been treating the hulk like hes some kind of disease
something to get rid of
but then i start looking at him as the cure
eighteen months in the gamma lab
i put the brains and the brawn together
and now look at me
best of both worlds
 excuse me mr hulk  yes
can we get a photo
100 little person
come on step on up do you mind
 oh yeah yeah  thanks
say green
 green  green

 i dont want to do it  we can do it
 no you feel bad  take the goddamn phone
okay
 thank you mr hulk  no it was great kids thank you very much
hulk out
bruce
dab
 bruce  listen to your mom
she knows better
about what we were saying
right
the whole time travel doover
guys its outside of my area of expertise
well you pulled this off
i remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible too
ive got a mild inspiration id like to see if it checks out
so id like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night
this time in the shape of a mobius strip inverted please
processing
right give me the eigenvalue of that particle
factoring in spectral decomp
 thatll take a second  just a moment
and dont worry if it doesnt pan out im just kinda
model rendered
shit
shit
what are you doing up little miss
 shit  nope we dont say that
only mommy says that word
she coined it it belongs to her
why are you up
cause ive got some important shit going on here
why do you think
no i got something on my mind i got something on my mind
was it juice pops
sure was
thats extortion thats a word
what kind you want
great minds think alike
juice pops exactly
was on my mind
you done yeah
now you are
here wipe
good that face goes there
tell me a story

night night
not that its a competition
but she loves me 3000
does she now
you were somewhere in the low 6 to 900 range
whatcha reading
just a book on composting
whats new with composting
 interesting science  i figured it out
by the way
and you know just so were talking about the same thing
time travel
what
wow
thats amazing
and terrifying
thats right
we got really lucky
yeah
i know
a lot of people didnt
nope and i cant help everybody
sorta seems like you can
not if i stop
i can put a pin in it right now and stop
tony
trying to get you to stop
has been one of the few failures of my entire life
something tells me
i should put it in a lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake
and go to bed
but would you be able to rest
okay here we go time travel test number one
scott fire up
the van thing
breakers are set
emergency generators are on standby
good because if we blow the grid i dont want to lose tiny here in the 1950s
excuse me
hes kidding
you cant say things like that
it was a bad joke
you were kidding right
i have no idea were talking about time travel here
either its all a joke or none of it is
were good
get your helmet on
scott im gonna send you back a week
let you walk around for an hour then bring you back in 10 seconds
make sense
perfectly not confusing
good luck scott you got this
youre right i do captain america

three two one
guys
this doesnt feel right
what is this
 whats going on  who is that
 hold on  is that scott
yes its scott

oh my god
and kill it
somebody peed my pants
oh thank god
but i dont know if it was baby me or old me
or just me me
time travel
what
i see this as an absolute win
why the long face
let me guess he turned into a baby
among other things yeah what are you doing here
its the epr paradox
instead of pushing lang through time you mightve wound up
pushing time through lang
its tricky dangerous somebody could have cautioned you against it
you did
oh did i
well thank god im here
regardless i fixed it
a fully functioning timespace gps
i just want peace
turns out resentment is corrosive and i hate it
me too
we got a shot at getting these stones but i got to tell you my priorities
bring back what we lost i hope yes
keep what i found i have to at all costs
and maybe not die trying
would be nice
sounds like a deal
tony i dont know
why
he made it for you
plus honestly i have to get it out of the garage before morgan takes it sledding
thank you tony
will you keep that a little quiet
didnt bring one for the whole team
we are getting the whole team yeah
were working on that right now

yeah we dont actually say that name in here
please take your hand off me
now i know that guy
might scare you
why would i be
why would i be scared of that guy
im the one who killed that guy remember
anyone else here kill that guy
nope
didnt think so
korg why dont you tell everybody who chopped thanos big head off
stormbreaker
who was swinging stormbreaker
i get it youre in a rough spot okay
ive been there myself
and you want to know who helped me out of it
was it natasha
it was you
you helped me
so why dont you ask
the asgardians down there
how much my help is worth
the ones that are left anyway
i think we could bring them back
stop
stop okay
i know you think im down here wallowing in my own selfpity
waiting to be rescued and saved
but im fine okay were fine arent we
were good here mate
so whatever it is that youre offering were not into it
dont care couldnt care less
goodbye
we need you pal
theres beer on the ship
what kind
its him hes after akihiko
why are you doing this
we never did anything to you
you survived
half the planet didnt
they got thanos
you get me
youre done hurting people
we hurt people
youre crazy
wait help me
ill give you anything
what do you want
what i want you cant give me
you shouldnt be here
neither should you
ive got a job to do
is that what youre calling this
killing all these people isnt gonna bring your family back
we found something
a chance maybe
dont
dont what
dont give me hope
im sorry i couldnt give it to you sooner
youre drifting left
one side there lebowski
ratchet hows it going
its rocket
take it easy youre only a genius on earth pal
time travel suit not bad
hey hey hey easy easy
im being very careful
no youre being very hulky
im being careful
these are pym particles all right
and ever since hank pym got snapped out of existence this is it
this is what we have were not making any more
 scott calm down  sorry
weve got enough for one roundtrip each thats it
no doovers
plus two test runs
one test run
all right im not ready for this
im game
ill do it
clint now youre gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift
 dont worry about that  wait a second let me ask you something
if we can do this you know
go back in time why dont we just find baby thanos
you know and
 first of all thats horrible  its thanos
and secondly time doesnt work that way
changing the past doesnt change the future
look we go back we get the stones before thanos gets them
thanos doesnt have the stones problem solved
 bingo  thats not how it works
 well thats what i heard  wait but who who told you that
star trek terminator timecop
 time after time  quantum leap
 wrinkle in time somewhere in time  hot tub time machine
hot tub time machine bill and teds excellent adventure
basically any movie that deals with time travel
die hard no thats not one
this is known
i dont know why everyone believes that but that isnt true
think about it if you travel to the past
that past becomes your future
and your former present becomes the past
which cant now be changed by your new future
exactly
so back to the future is a bunch of bullshit
all right clint
were going in three two
one
cooper
where are my headphones
lila
 i never had them  lila
yeah you had them yesterday
lila lila
yeah dad
dad
lila
hey hey look at me
you okay
yeah yeah
it worked
it worked
okay so the how works
now we got to figure out the when and the where
almost everyone in this room has had an encounter
with at least one of the six infinity stones
or substitute the word encounter
for damn near been killed by one of the six infinity stones
well i havent
but i dont even know what the hell youre all talking about
regardless we only have enough pym particles for one roundtrip each
and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history
our history
so not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in yeah
which means we have to pick our targets
correct
so lets start with the aether
thor what do you know
is he asleep
no no im pretty sure hes dead
where to start
the aether firstly is not a stone
someone called it a stone before
its more of an angry sludge sort of a thing
so someones gonna need to amend that and stop saying that
heres an interesting story though about the aether
my grandfather many years ago
had to hide the stone from the dark elves
scary beings
so jane actually
oh there she is
yeah so jane was an old flame of mine
you know she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time
and then the aether stuck itself inside her
and she became very very sick
and so i had to take her to asgard which is where im from
and we had to try and fix her
we were dating at the time you see
and i got to introduce her to my mother
whos dead and
oh you know jane and i arent even dating anymore so
yes these things happen though you know
nothing lasts forever the only thing that
 why dont you come sit down  im not done yet
the only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence
awesome eggs breakfast
no id like a bloody mary
quill said he stole the power stone from morag
 is that a person  no morags a planet
quill was a person
like a planet like in outer space
oh look its like a little puppy all happy and everything
do you wanna go to space you wanna go to space puppy
ill take you to space
thanos found the soul stone on vormir
what is vormir
a dominion of death
at the very center of celestial existence
its where thanos murdered my sister
not it
 that time stone guy  doctor strange
yeah what kind of doctor was he
earnosethroat meets rabbitfromhat
nice place in the village though
yeah on sullivan street
bleecker street
wait he lived in new york
 no he lived in toronto  yeah on bleecker and sullivan
 have you been listening to anything  guys
if you pick the right year there are three stones in new york
shut the front door
all right we have a plan
six stones three teams one shot
five years ago we lost
all of us
we lost friends
we lost family
we lost a part of ourselves
today we have a chance to take it all back
you know your teams you know your missions
get the stones get them back
one roundtrip each
no mistakes
no doovers
most of us are going somewhere we know
that doesnt mean we should know what to expect
be careful
look out for each other
this is the fight of our lives
and were gonna win
whatever it takes
good luck
hes pretty good at that
 right  all right
you heard the man stroke those keys jolly green
trackers engaged
you promise to bring that back in one piece right
yeah yeah yeah
okay ill do my best
as promises go that was pretty lame
see ya in a minute
all right we all have our assignments
two stones uptown one stone down
stay low keep an eye on the clock
maybe smash a few things along the way
i think its gratuitous but whatever
id be careful going that way we just had the floors waxed
yeah im looking for doctor strange
youre about five years too early
stephen strange is currently performing surgery about 20 blocks that way
what do you want from him
that actually
im afraid not
sorry but i wasnt asking
you dont want to do this
youre right i dont but i need that stone
and i dont have time to debate it
lets start over shall we
for you lady jane
do you have anything with pants
pants
never mind these will be fine thank you
 yes milady  theres jane
all right
heres the deal tubby
youre gonna charm her and im gonna poke her with this thing
and extract the reality stone and get gone licketysplit
ill be right back okay the wine cellar is just down here
my father used to have this huge barrel of aakonian ale
ill see if the scullery has a couple of togo cups
hey hey arent you drunk enough already
 if you could send loki some soup  yes milady
and ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf
whos the fancy broad
thats my mother
she dies today
oh that is today
i cant do this i cant do this
i shouldnt be here i shouldnt have come
its a bad idea
 come here  no no no
i think im having a panic attack

you think youre the only one who lost people
what do you think were doing here
i lost the only family i ever had
quill groot drax the chick with the antenna
all gone
i get you miss your mom
but shes gone
really gone
and there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone
and you can help them
so is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard
make schmoopy talk to pretty pants
and when shes not looking suck out the infinity stone
and help me get my family back
okay
are you crying
no
yes
i feel like im losing it

thats been shieid property for over 70 years
hand over the case stark

no stairs
come on stark stay with us
im going to try something okay i have no idea if its going to work
yes
oh that worked a treat
dude that was so crazy
i had no idea if that was gonna work
 the case  the case is
wheres the case wheres loki
loki
that wasnt supposed to happen was it
we blew it
loki
tony whats going on
tell me you found that cube
you got to be shitting me
i have eyes on loki 14th floor
im not loki
and i dont wanna hurt you
i can do this all day
yeah i know
i know
where did you get this
bucky is alive
what
that is americas ass
please please
im sorry i cant help you bruce
if i give up the time stone to help your reality im dooming my own
with all due respect all right
im not sure the science really supports that
the infinity stones create what you experience as the flow of time
remove one of the stones
and that flow splits
now this may benefit your reality
but my new one not so much
in this new branch reality
without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness
our world would be overrun
millions will suffer
so tell me doctor
can your science prevent all that
no
but we can erase it
because once were done with the stones
we can return each one to its own timeline
at the moment it was taken
so chronologically
in that reality
it never left
yes but youre leaving out the most important part
in order to return the stones you have to survive
we will i will i promise
i cant risk this reality on a promise
its the duty of the sorcerer supreme to protect the time stone
then why the hell did strange give it away
what did you say
strange he gave it away he gave it to thanos
 willingly  yes
 why  i have no idea
maybe he made a mistake
or i did
strange is meant to be the best of us
so he mustve done it for a reason
i fear you might be right
thank you
im counting on you bruce
we all are
run diagnostics
show me her memory file
sire the file appears entangled
it was a memory but not hers
theres another consciousness
sharing her network
another nebula
impossible
this duplicate carries a time stamp
from nine years in the future
where is this other nebula
in our solar system on morag
can you access her
yes the two are linked
search the duplicates memories
for infinity stones
and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history
our history
so not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in
which means we have to pick our targets
 correct  freeze image
terrans
avengers
unruly wretches
whats that reflection
amplify this maw
i dont understand
two nebulas
no the same nebula
from two different times
set course for morag

let me ask you a question
when your kid was born were you nervous
wildly
 yeah  did you feel qualified
like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing
i literally pieced it together as i went along
i thought about what my dad did
my old man he never met a problem he couldnt solve with a belt
i thought my dad was tough on me
and now looking back on it i just remember the good stuff
you know he did drop the odd pearl
yeah like what
no amount of money ever bought a second of time

who are you
consider me a guide
to you

if only it were that easy
what you seek lies in front of you
as does what you fear
the stones down there
for one of you
for the other
in order to take the stone
you must lose that which you love
an everlasting exchange
a soul for a soul
hows it going
jesus
maybe hes making this shit up
no
i dont think so
why cause he knows your daddys name
i didnt
thanos left here with the stone
without his daughter
thats not a coincidence
yeah
whatever it takes
whatever it takes
if we dont get that stone
billions of people stay dead

i guess we do
im starting to think we mean different people here natasha

so we keep it that way
you know its a trap right
yeah
i dont much care
good
just as long as were all in agreement
lets kill him properly this time
you could not live with your own failure
where did that bring you
back to me
i thought by eliminating half of life
the other half would thrive
but youve shown me
thats impossible
and as long as there are those that remember what was
there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be
they will resist
yep were all kinds of stubborn
im thankful
because now
i know what i must do
i will shred this universe
down to its last atom
and then
with the stones youve collected for me
create a new one
teeming with life
that knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given
a grateful universe
born out of blood
theyll never know it
because you wont be alive to tell them
see you on the other side man
hang on im coming

im hoping if you play this back
its in celebration
i hope families are reunited i hope we get it back
and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored
if there ever was such a thing
god what a world universe now
if you told me 10 years ago that we werent alone
let alone to this extent i mean i wouldnt have been surprised
but come on who knew
the epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play
and for better or worse
thats the reality morgans gonna have to find a way to grow up in
so i thought id probably better record a little greeting
in the case of an untimely death on my part
not that death at any time isnt untimely
this time travel thing that were gonna try and pull off tomorrow
its got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all
thats the thing
then again thats the hero gig right

please
where did he come from
odin once
mankind accepted a simple truth
that they were not alone in this universe
some worlds man believed to be home to their gods
others they knew to fear
from a realm of cold and darkness came the frost giants
screams
threatening to plunge the mortal world into a new ice age
roars
but humanity would not face this threat alone
yelling
our armies drove the frost giants back into the heart of their own world
the cost was great
in the end
their king fell
and the source of their power was taken from them
with the last great war ended
we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home
to the realm eternal
asgard
here we remain as a beacon of hope
shining out across the stars
and though we have fallen into mans myths and legends
it was asgard
and its warriors
that brought peace
to the universe
but the day will come
when one of you
will have to defend that peace
do the frost giants still live
when im king
ill hunt the monsters down and slay them all
just as you did father
a wise king
never seeks out war
but he must always be ready for it
 im ready father  so am i
only one of you can ascend to the throne
but both of you were born to be kings
all cheering
oh please
spear thudding
thor odinson
my heir
my firstborn
so long entrusted with the mighty hammer mjolnir
forged in the heart of a dying star
its power has no equal
as a weapon to destroy
or as a tool to build
tis a fit companion for a king
i have defended asgard
and the lives of the innocent across the nine realms
from the time of the great beginning
though the day has come
do you swear to guard the nine realms
i swear
and do you swear to preserve the peace
i swear
do you swear
to cast aside all selfish ambition
and to pledge yourself only to the good of the realms
i swear
then on this day
i odin allfather
proclaim you
the frost giants
spear thudding
thor the jotuns must pay for what theyve done
they have paid with their lives
the destroyer did its work
the casket is safe and all is well
all is well
they broke into the weapons vault
if the frost giants had stolen even one of these relics
 they didnt  well i want to know why
i have a truce with laufey king of the jotuns
he just broke your truce they know you are vulnerable
what action would you take
march into jotunheim as you once did teach them a lesson
break their spirits
so theyll never dare try to cross our borders again
youre thinking only as a warrior
this was an act of war
it was the act of but a few doomed to fail
look how far they got
we will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed
as king of asgard
but youre not king
not yer
roaring
its unwise to be in my company right now brother
this was to be my day of triumph
itll come
in time
whats this
if its any consolation i think youre right
about the frost giants about laufey about everything
if they found a way to penetrate asgards defenses once
whos to say they wont try again
 next time with an army  exactly
theres nothing you can do without defying father
no no no i know that look
thats the only way to ensure the safety of our borders
thor its madness
madness what sort of madness
were going to jotunheim
volstagg what
this isnt like a journey to earth
where you summon a little lightning and thunder
and the mortals worship you as a god
this is jotunheim
my father fought his way into jotunheim
defeated their armies and took their casket
we would just be looking for answers
it is forbidden
chuckles
my friends have you forgotten all that we have done together
fandral hogun
who led you into the most glorious of battles
you did
and volstagg to delicacies so succulent
you thought youd died and gone to valhalla
laughs
you did
yes
and who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea
that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors
this realm has ever known
i did
true but i supported you sif
my friends
were going to jotunheim
you leave this to me
 good heimdall  youre not dressed warmly enough
lm s o fry
do you think that you can deceive me
laughs you must be mistaken  thor enough
heimdall may we pass
never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day
i wish to know how that happened
then tell no one where we have gone until weve returned
understand
what happened silver tongue turn to lead
all laughing
heimdall be warned
i will honor my sworn oath to protect this realm as its gatekeeper
if your return threatens the safety of asgard
bifrost will remain closed to you
and youll be left to die in the cold waste of jotunheim
volstagg couldnt you just leave the bridge open for us
heimdall to leave the bridge open
would unleash the full power of the bifrost
and destroy jotunheim with you upon it
i have no plans to die today
none do
we shouldnt be here
lets move
where are they
hiding
as cowards always do
laufey youve come a long way to die asgardians
i am thor odinson
laufey we know who you are
how did your people get into asgarol
exhales slowly
the house of odin is full of traitors
do not dishonor my fathers name with your lies
your father is a murderer and a thief
and why have you come here to make peace
you long for battle you crave it
youre nothing but a boy
trying to prove himself a man
thor well this boy has grown tired of your mockery
thor stop and think
look around you were outnumbered
know your place brother
you know not what your actions would unleash
i do
go now while i still allow it
we will accept your most gracious offer
grunts
come on brother
frost giant run back home little princess
damn

laughing
yelling
at least make it a challenge for me
roaring
thats more like it
groans
dont let them touch you
screams
thor
 we must go  then go
run
thor
roars
laughing
heimdall
open the bridge
roaring
horse whinnying
father well finish them together
silence
allfather
you look weary
laufey
end this now
your boy sought this out
youre right
and these are the actions of a boy treat them as such
you and i can end this here and now before theres further bloodshed
we are beyond diplomacy now allfather
hell get what he came for
war
and death
so be it
thor why did you bring us back
odin do you realize what youve done
 what youve started  thor i was protecting my home
you cannot even protect your friends
how can you hope to protect a kingdom
get him to the healing room now
thor there wont be a kingdom to protect if youre afraid to act
the jotuns must learn to fear me just as they once feared you
odin thats pride and vanity talking not leadership
youve forgotten everything i taught you about a warriors patience
while you wait and be patient the nine realms laugh at us
the old ways are done
youd stand giving speeches while asgard falls
you are a vain greedy cruel boy
and you are an old man and a fool
yes
i was a fool
to think you were ready
 father odin shouts
thor odinson
you have betrayed the express command of your king
through your arrogance and stupidity
youve opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives
to the horror and desolation of war
you are unworthy of these realms
youre unworthy of your title
youre unworthy
of the loved ones you have betrayed
i now take from you your power
in the name of my father
and his father before
i odin allfather cast you out
whosoever holds this hammer if he be worthy
shall possess the power of thor
darcy and jane screaming
darcy i think that was legally your fault
jane get the first aid kit
do me a favor and dont be dead
gasps
whoa does he need cpr because i totally know cpr
groans
where did he come from
you all right
hammer
hammer
yeah we can tell youre hammered its pretty obvious
gasps oh my god erik look at this
we have to move quickly before this all changes
jane we have to take him to the hospital
 father  jane hes fine look at him
heimdall i know you can hear me open the bifrost
jane hospital you go ill stay
you what realm is this
alfheim nornheim
new mexico
you dare threaten me thor with so puny a weapon
fires taser gun
shuddering
what he was freaking me out
next time you decide to taser somebody
make sure hes already in the car okay
jane come on
nurse name
he said it was thor
thor
 and your relationship to him  ive never met him before
until she hit him with a car
i grazed him but she tasered him
yes i did
hi
just taking a little blood
how dare you attack the son of odin
male nurse i need some help
call security
man security to er 3 stat
youre no match for the mighty
huh
erik you dont think this was just a magnetic storm do you
look the lensing around these edges
is characteristic of an einsteinrosen bridge
a what
 i thought you were a science major  political science
she was the only applicant
an einsteinrosen bridge is a theoretical connection
between two different points of spacetime
its a wormhole
 erik look what do you see  stars
yeah but not our stars
see this is the star alignment for our quadrant this time of year
and unless ursa minor decided to take a day off
these are someone elses constellations
hey check this out
no it cant be
i think i left something at the hospital
its not possible
panting
he was on drugs or something he just went nuts
darcy oh my god
i just lost my most important piece of evidence
typical
 so now what  we find him
did you see what he did in there
im not sure finding him is the best idea
well our data cant tell us what it was like to be inside that event
and he can so were gonna find him
darcy okay
so were gonna look all over new mexico right
exactly
jan e what
im so sorry i swear im not doing this on purpose
upbeat music playing
i got it i got it
man come on kick it in now
engine rewing
all exclaiming
did it work
laughing
sir we found it
you know for a crazy homeless person hes pretty cut
hey sorry i tased you
excuse me excuse me
what is this
oh
my ex
good with patients and bad with relationships
theyre the only clothes i had that would fit you
they will suffice
youre welcome
thor this mortal form has grown weak
i need sustenance
we should never have let him go
there was no stopping him
fandral well at least hes only banished not dead
which is what wed all be
if that guard hadnt told odin where wed gone
how did the guard even know
i told him
what
i told him to go to odin after wed left
he should be flogged for taking so long
we should never have reached jotunheim
you told the guard
i saved our lives
and thors
i had no idea father would banish him for what he did
loki
you must go to the allfather and convince him to change his mind
and if i do then what
i love thor more dearly than any of you but you know what he is
hes arrogant hes reckless hes dangerous
you saw how he was today
is that what asgard needs from its king
he may speak of the good of asgard but hes always been jealous of thor
we should be grateful to him he saved our lives
laufey said
there were traitors in the house of odin
a master of magic could bring three jotuns into asgard
fandral lokis always been one for mischief
but youre talking about something else entirely
odin stop
loki am i cursed
odin no
what am i
youre my son
what more than that
the casket wasnt the only thing you took from jotunheim that day
was it
no
in the aftermath of the battle
i went into the temple and i found a baby
crying
small for a giants offspring
abandoned suffering left to die
laufeys son
laufeys son
yes
why
you were kneedeep in jotun blood why would you take me
you were an innocent child
no you took me for a purpose what was it
shouting tell me
i thought we could unite our kingdoms one day
bring about an alliance bring about permanent peace
through you
what
but those plans no longer matter
so i am no more than another stolen relic
locked up here until you might have use of me
why do you twist my words
you could have told me what i was from the beginning
why didnt you
youre my son
i wanted only to protect you from the truth
because im the monster
parents tell their children about at night
 no no  you know it all makes sense now
why you favored thor all these years
because no matter how much you claim to love me
you could never have a frost giant sitting on the throne of asgard
guards
guards please help
jane howd you get inside that cloud
darcy also how could you eat an entire box of poptarts
and still be this hungry
 this drink i like it  i know its great right

man 1 theyre saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert
man 2 yeah we were having a good time with it
until the feds showed up
jane excuse me did you say there was a satellite crash
man 2 yeah
oh my god this is going on facebook smile
what did it look like the satellite
i dont know anything about satellites but it was heavy
i mean nobody could lift it
they said it was radioactive i had my hands all over it

looked like the whole army was coming when we left
brakes squealing honking
driver dumbass
where are you going
 fifty miles west of here  why
 to get what belongs to me  oh so you own a satellite now
its not what they say it is
well whatever it is
the government seems to think its theirs

yes
if you take me there now
ill tell you everything you wish to know
 everything  yes
all the answers you seek will be yours once i reclaim mjolnir
myeumuh whats myeumuh
can i have a word jane
please dont do this
softly you saw what i saw last night
this is no coincidence we have to find out whats in that crater
but im not talking about the crater im talking about him
 but hes promising us the answers  hes delusional
listen to what hes saying
hes talking about mjolnir and thor and bifrost
its the stories i grew up with as a child
im just going to drive him thats it
hes dangerous jane
im sorry but i cant take you

ms foster im agent coulson with shield
is that supposed to mean something to me
 you cant do this  jane
jane this is a lot more serious than you realize let it go
let it go this is my life
were investigating a security threat
we need to appropriate your records and all your atmospheric data
by appropriate do you mean steal
here this should more than compensate you
for your trouble
i cant just buy replacements at radio shack
i made most of this equipment myself
then im sure you can do it again
and im sure i can sue you for violating my constitutional rights
im sorry ms foster but were the good guys
so are we
im on the verge of understanding something extraordinary
and everything i know about this phenomenon
is either in this lab or in this book
and you cant just take this away hey
jane easy easy jane
thank you for your cooperation
years of research
gone
darcy they even took my ipod
erik what about the backups jane they took our backups
they took the backups of our backups they were extremely thorough
i just downloaded like 30 songs onto there
could you please stop with your ipod
who are these people
i knew this scientist
the pioneer in gamma radiation
shield showed up
and he wasnt heard from again
theyre not gonna do that to us im gonna get everything back
come on please let me contact one of my colleagues
hes had some dealings with these people before
ill email him and maybe he can help
they took your laptop too
allfather we must speak with you urgently
my friends
wheres odin
father has fallen into the odinsleep
mother fears he may never awaken again
we would speak with her
she has refused to leave my fathers bedside
you can bring your urgent matter to me
spear thudding
your king
my king we would ask that you end thors banishment
chuckles
my first command cannot be to undo the allfathers last
were on the brink of war with jotunheim
our people need a sense of continuity
in order to feel safe in these difficult times
all of us must stand together
for the good of asgard
yes of course
 good then you will wait for my word  if i may
beg the indulgence of your majesty to perhaps reconsider
were done
scoffs
i need a horse
we dont have horses just dogs cats birds
then give me one of those large enough to ride
honking  hey you still need a lift
ive never done anything like this before
have you ever done anything like this before
many times
but youre brave to do it
well they just stole my entire lifes work
i dont really have much left to lose
yeah but youre clever
far more clever than anyone else in this realm
realm realm
 you think me strange  yeah i do
good strange or bad strange
im not quite sure yet
tires screeching
both laughing
im sorry
but who are you
really
youll see soon enough
you promised me answers
what you seek its a bridge
like an einsteinrosen bridge
more like a rainbow bridge
god i hope youre not crazy
loki softly i never get used to seeing him like this
frigga hes put it off for so long now that i fear
how long will it last
i dont know this time its different we were unprepared
so why did he lie
he kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different
you are our son loki
and we your family
we mustnt lose hope that your father will return to us
and your brother
what hope is there for thor
theres always a purpose to everything your father does
thunder crashing
jan e thats no satellite crash
they would have hauled the wreckage away
they wouldnt have built a city around it
 youre going to need this  what wait why
thunder rumbling
now stay here
once i have mjolnir i will return the items theyve stolen from you
deal
no look whats down there
you think youre just gonna walk in grab our stuff and walk out
no im going to fly out
technician sir feed from the keyhole can barely penetrate the cloud cover
techs barely working as it is
with all the interference that things giving off
and weve got a commercial aircraft coming right over us
southwest airlines flight 5434
reroute it like all the others
hold a sec
weve got something outside the fence west side
agent delancey jackson west side perimeter go check it out
there it is
delancey jackson report
agent down weve got a perimeter breach
klaxons blaring
gasps
youve reached dr erik selvig please leave me a message
hi erik its me dont worry im fine
but just in case you dont hear from me in the next hour
just come by the crater site and try and find me okay
i did exactly what you told me not to im sorry
so sorry bye
agent 1 bravo quadrant move
thunder crashing
highpitched hum
agent 2 entering south tunnel
agent 3 negative negative i have no comms
agent 4 target sighted east tunnel
i need eyes up high with a gun
moving north
what have we got
theres a massive electromagnetic surge
coming off that thing
systems are barely coping
barton talk to me
you want me to slow him down sir
or are you sending in more guys for him to beat up
ill let you know
youre big
fought bigger
better call it coulson cause im starting to root for this guy
last chance sir
coulson wait i want to see this
grunting
screaming
all right shows over ground units move in
erik he committed a crime hes in jail
jane i cant just leave him there erik why
you didnt see what i saw
darcy gasps look look its myeumuh
whered you find this
erik the childrens section
i just wanted to show you how silly his story was
but youre the one whos always pushing me
to chase down every possibility every alternative
im talking about science not magic
well magics just science that we dont understand yet
 arthur c clarke  who wrote science fiction
 a precursor to science fact  in some cases yeah
well if there is an einsteinrosen bridge
then theres something on the other side
and advanced beings could have crossed it
jane
a primitive culture like the vikings might have worshipped them as deities
yes yes exactly thank you
mmmhmm
sighs
coulson you made my men
some of the most highly trained professionals in the world
look like a bunch of minimumwage mall cops
thats hurtful
in my experience it takes someone whos received similar training
to do what you did to them
why dont you tell me where you received your training
pakistan chechnya afghanistan
no you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type
where was it south africa
certain groups pay very well for a good mercenary like you
who are you
one way or another we find out what we need to know
were good at that
pager beeping
dont go anywhere
loki what are you doing here
i had to see you
whats happened
tell me is it jotunheim
let me explain to father
father is dead
what
your banishment
the threat of a new war
it was too much for him to bear
you mustnt blame yourself
i know that you loved him
i tried to tell him so but he wouldnt listen
it was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach
knowing that you could never lift it
the burden of the throne has fallen to me now
can i come home
the truce with jotunheim is conditional upon your exile
 yes but couldnt we find a way  and mother has forbidden your return
this is goodbye brother
im so sorry
no
i am sorry
thank you for coming here
farewell
goodbye
good bye
i just got back
static crackling
mjolnir humming
sir
hes got a visitor
his name is donald blake
dr donald blake
you have dangerous coworkers dr selvig
he was distraught when he found out that youve taken all our research
that was years of his life gone
you can understand how a man could go off like that
a big faceless organization like yours
coming in with their jackbooted thugs and
thats how he put it
that still doesnt explain
how he managed to tear through our security
steroids hes a bit of a fitness nut
alarm beeps
technician sir
it says here that hes an md
well he is or he was
he switched careers and became a physicist
a brilliant physicist
hes a wonderful man hes a man in pain
erik oh donny donny donny
there you are youre gonna be all right im taking you home now
coulson dr selvig
just keep him away from the bars
i will
 where are we going  to get a drink
follow them
you know i had it all backwards
i had it all wrong
its not a bad thing finding out that you dont have all the answers
you start asking the right questions
for the first time in my life
i have no idea what im supposed to do
anyone whos ever going to find his way in this world
has to start by admitting he doesnt know where the hell he is
thank you for what youve done
no dont thank me i only did it for jane
her father and i taught at university together
he was a good man
he never listened
neither did i
my father was trying to teach me something
but i was too stupid to see it
i dont know if youre delusional or if youre pulling some kind of con
i dont care
i just care about her
ive seen the way she looks at you
i swear to you i mean her no harm
good
in that case ill buy you another round and you leave town tonight
two boilermakers
laufey kill him
after all ive done for you
so youre the one who showed us the way into asgard
that was just a bit of fun really
to ruin my brothers big day
and to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer
i will hear you
i will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers
lead you into odins chambers and you can slay him where he lies
why not kill him yourself
snorts
i suspect that the asgardians would not take kindly
to a king who had murdered his predecessor
once odin is dead i will return the casket to you
and you can return jotunheim to all its
glory

accept
what troubles you gatekeeper
i turned my gaze upon you in jotunheim but could neither see you nor hear you
you were shrouded from me
like the frost giants that entered this realm
perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service
or perhaps someone has found a way
to hide that which he does not wish me to see
you have great power heimdall
did odin ever fear you
 no  and why is that
because he is my king and i am sworn to obey him
he was your king and youre sworn to obey me now
yes
yes
then you will open the bifrost to no one
until i have repaired the damage that my brother has done
banging on door
gasps oh my god is he okay
hes fine not injured at all
groans  im sorry my friend
 what happened  we drank we fought
he made his ancestors proud
put him on the bed
groans
laughing
i still dont think youre the god of thunder
but you ought to be
are these your chambers
its more of a temporary living situation
im sorry i dont usually have guests
actually i never have guests
thats not the right place for it
im sorry
can we go outside
yes of course
i come up here sometimes when i cant sleep
or im trying to reconcile particle data or when darcys driving me crazy
i come up here a lot actually now that i think about it
im really glad youre safe
youve been very kind to me
and ive been far less grateful than you deserve
well i hit you with my car a couple times
so i think that kind of evens things out
perhaps i had it coming
oh my god
i dont believe it
it was all i could get back im sorry its not as much as i promised
no no this is great this is i dont have to start from scratch now
thank you
whats wrong
shleld
whatever they are
theyre gonna do everything in their power
to make sure this research never sees the light of day
no jane
listen to me you must not give up
 you must finish what youve started  why
because youre right
here look
your ancestors called it magic and you call it science
well i come from a place where theyre one and the same thing
what is that
my father explained it to me like this
that your world
is one of the nine realms of the cosmos
linked to each other by the branches of yggdrasil
the worlds tree
now you see it every day without realizing
the images glimpsed through what did you call it
this hooble telescope
 hubble  hubble telescope
laughs
tell me more
so the nine realms
now there is midgard which is earth
this is alfheim
vanaheim jotunheim
and asgard
and thats where i come from
thank you jane
fandral our dearest friend banished loki on the throne
asgard on the brink of war yet youve managed to consume
four wild boar six pheasant a side of beef
and two casks of ale shame on you dont you care
do not mistake my appetite for apathy
stop it both of you
stop
 we all know what we have to do  we must go
we must find thor
its treason
to hell with treason its suicide
thor would do the same for us
now shush
heimdall might be watching
doors opening
heimdall demands your presence
volstagg were doomed
you would defy the commands of loki our king
break every oath you have taken as warriors
and commit treason to bring thor back
 yes  good
so youll help us
i am bound by honor to our king i cannot open the bridge to you
complicated fellow isnt he
now what do we do
look
 what the hell was that  i dont know sir
we got massive energy readings out of nowhere
and then they just disappeared fifteen miles due northwest
lets go take a look
thank you
 thank you  youre very welcome
agent base to team 2 weve got activity outside the town

is dead because of me
and i must remain in exile
thor
your father still lives
tell me loki how did you get the jotuns into asgarol
you think the bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm
there are secret paths between the worlds
to which even you with all your gifts are blind
but i have need of them no longer now that i am king
and i say for your act of treason
you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper
and no longer citizen of asgard
then i need no longer obey you

heimdall

laufey its said

i hope its true
so that you may know
your death came at the hand
of laufey
and your death came by the son of odin
gasping
loki
you saved him
i swear to you mother
that they will pay for what theyve done today
thor loki
thor
i knew youd return to us
why dont you tell her
how you sent the destroyer to kill our friends to kill me
what
why it must have been enforcing fathers last command
youre a talented liar brother always have been
its good to have you back
now if youll excuse me i have to destroy jotunheim
loki you cant stop it
the bifrost will build until it rips jotunheim apart
frost giants screaming
jane
why have you done this
to prove to father that i am the worthy son
when he wakes i will have saved his life
i will have destroyed that race of monsters
and i will be true heir to the throne
you cant kill an entire race
why not
and what is this newfound love for the frost giants
you could have killed them all with your bare hands
 ive changed  so have i
now fight me
i never wanted the throne
i only ever wanted to be your equal
i will not fight you brother
im not your brother
i never was
loki this is madness

for you
for all of us
no loki
loki no

no
jane its gone
all laughing
and then with a mighty bellow
i flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low
fandral is that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass
volstagg as a matter of fact falling was a tactic lulling the destroyer
my queen im so sorry for your loss
frigga how is he
sif he mourns for his brother
and
he misses hen
the mortal
youll be a wise king
there will never be a wiser king than you
or a better father

i was thinking theyre taking me down here to kill me
ive been hearing about the new mexico situation
your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than i am
i have a lot to work with
the foster theory a gateway to another dimension
its unprecedented

legend tells us one thing history another
but every now and then we find something that belongs to both
what is it
power doctor
if we can figure out how to tap it
maybe unlimited power
well i guess thats worth a look
well i guess thats worth a look
nick this was a tragedy but its not why were here
what are we fighting the weather now
locals say the cyclone had a face
people see things when theyre under stress
that does not mean that this is the start to some other big worldending
who are you
you dont want any part of this
gone but not forgotten
thanks to kenneth lim and vihaan ramamurthy
for their help with that touching video tribute
this year has been nothing short of  it is crazy its insane
jason what
no swearing
its the last day of school were good
historic
over five years ago half of all life in the universe
including our own midtown high was wiped from existence
then eight months ago a band of brave heroes
brought us back
they called it the blip
those of us who blipped away came back the same age
but our classmates that didnt blip had grown five years older
my little brother is now older than me yeah its math
even though we had blipped away halfway through the school year
and had already taken midterms
the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning
its totally unfair
its not right
tigers its been a long dramatic somewhat confusing road
as we draw this year to a close
its time to move on
to a new phase of our lives pray nothing crazy happens again
because are the avengers even a thing anymore
does anyone even have a plan i have a plan
okay first im gonna sit next to mj on the flight
second im gonna buy a dualheadphone adapter
and watch movies with her the whole time
okay three when we go to venice
venice is famous for making stuff out of glass right
true so im gonna buy her
a black dahlia necklace because her favorite flower is the black dahlia
because of well the murder
the murder four when we go to paris
im gonna take her to the top of the eiffel tower
give her the necklace
then five im gonna tell her how i feel
then six hopefully she tells me she feels the same way
oh dont forget step seven

i just wanna spend some time with mj
we were talking about paris and i think she really likes me
thats nice
reminds me of when betty and i first fell in love
i had just finished my fruit cobbler right and
youre a very difficult person to contact spiderman
youre nick fury
and you just shot ned
its a mild tranquilizer hell be all right
so good to finally meet you
i saw you at the funeral
but i didnt think that was a good time to exchange numbers
that wouldve been inappropriate
thats what i just said right
the important thing is youre here i tried to bring you here
you avoided me and now youre here
what a coincidence
wait was this a coincidence
i used to know everything
then i come back five years later and now i know nothing
no intel no team
and a high school kid
is dodging my calls
heres what i do know
a week ago a village in mexico was wiped out by a cyclone
witnesses say that cyclone had a face
three days later a similar event in morocco
a village was
just making the rounds
see if anyone needs any counseling after todays traumatic events
no well be okay were fine thank you
great because im im not qualified to actually
oh hes passed out
im not qualified to do it anyway so good night
that was my teacher sorry about that you were saying
a village was destroyed by what may well be another worldthreatening
babe you still awake youre not answering any of my texts
hes asleep betty
oh already
yeah okay
thats why its imperative
hey boys so that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria
another person touches that door we are going to attend another funeral
suit up let me know if you develop vomiting
stark left these for you
really
uneasy lies the head that wears the crown
stark said you wouldnt get that because its not a star wars reference
you can lose the mask everyone here has seen you without it
youd be feigning anonymity
and breathing through spandex for no good reason
come on
yeah
over there we have maria hill
that is dimitri
and this is mr beck
mysterio
what
doesnt matter its just what my friends have been calling you
well you can call me quentin
you handled yourself well out there today i saw what you did with the tower
we could use someone like you on my world
thanks
im sorry your world
mr beck is from earth
just not yours
there are multiple realities
this is earth dimension 616 im from earth 833
sorry youre saying theres a multiverse
i thought that was theoretical
that changes how we understand the initial singularity
were talking about an eternal inflation system
how does that even work with all the quantum
its insane
sorry its really cool
dont ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room
anyway
they were born in stable orbits within black holes
creatures formed from the primary elements
air water fire earth
the science division had a technical name
we just called them elementals
versions of them exist across our mythologies
turns out the myths are real
like thor
thor was a myth now i study him in my physics class
these myths are threats
they first materialized on my earth many years ago
we mobilized and fought them
but with each battle they grew got stronger
i was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them
all we did was delay the inevitable
the elementals are here now attacking the same coordinates
our satellites confirm it
thank mr beck for destroying the other three
theres only one left fire
the strongest of them all the one that destroyed my earth
its the one that took my family
im sorry
and it will be in prague in approximately 48 hours
we have one mission kill it and youre coming with us
im sorry did you say prague
mr fury this all seems like bigtime you know huge superhero kind of stuff
and im just a friendly neighborhood spiderman sir
bitch please youve been to space
i know but that was an accident
theres gotta be someone else you can use
what about thor offworld
okay doctor strange
unavailable captain marvel
dont invoke her name
sir look i wanna help i do
but if my aunt finds out i left my class trip shell kill me
and if im seen in europe after the washington monument
my class will figure out who i am then
then the whole world will figure out who i am and then im done
okay

and become suspicious

when that shows up i will radio you guys
and then mr beck and i will my name is mysterio
thats when mysterio and i will move in
peter listen to me
the best hope you have the only hope
is to stop it here now no matter what the cost
maneuver it away from civilians if you can
but most important keep it away from metal
if it gets too big itll draw power from the earths core
after that theres no way to stop it
hey my friends are here
i cant help but think were putting them in danger
youre worried about us hurting your friends
you who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus
stark gave you a multibilliondollar ar tactical intelligence system
and the first thing you do with it is try and blow up your friends
its clear to me that you were not ready for this
fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing
he just he felt bad about snapping at you
really
you guys do have sarcasm on this earth right
how you feeling
i didnt think i was gonna have to save the world this summer
i know that makes me sound like such a jerk i just
i had this plan with this girl that i really like
and now its all ruined
youre not a jerk for wanting a normal life kid
its a hard path
you see things you do things you make choices
people look up to you
and even if you win a battle sometimes they die
i like you peter youre a good kid
theres a part of me that wants me to tell you just
turn around run away from all this
then theres another part of me that knows what were about to fight
whats at stake and im glad youre here
me too
but youre worried about your friends
yeah
just always feel like im putting them in danger
look just get them inside and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours
theyll be all right
its really nice to have somebody to talk to about superhero stuff you know
anytime
and hey we survive this youll have all summer to kill brad
see you out there

i might have a mint

we need to stay vigilant
theres a void in this world for someone like you
hill and i are going to europol headquarters in berlin tomorrow
you should join us
thank you i just might take you up on that
you got gifts parker but you didnt wanna be here
mr fury i id love to have you in berlin too
but you got to decide whether youre going to step up or not
stark chose you
he made you an avenger
i need that
the world needs that
maybe stark was wrong
was he
the choice is yours
lets get a drink
im not 21
hey
you gotta celebrate we did something good tonight
yeah
fury was right
tony did a lot for me
so i owe it to him to everybody
do you
yeah i mean
mr stark gave me the chance to be more
he wanted me to be better than him
and fury wants me to live up to that what do you want
what do you mean what do you want
i dont know what do you want peter parker now
i know youre thinking about it i wanna go on my trip
i want to go back on my trip with my friends
and go to the top of the eiffel tower
with the girl who i really like and tell her how i feel
and give her a kiss
shut up man
youre not gonna do that are you no i cant
why not
because i have too much of a responsibility
my god thank you so much what are those
are those the edith glasses yeah
they were just on the floor try them on lets see how they look on you
yeah yeah
i actually really like them
can i be completely honest with you please
they look really stupid
but maybe they have a contactlens version
you try them on
no come on try them on
i dont wanna try them on just put them on
what do you think kid
next tony stark i trust you
for the next tony stark i trust you
what
stark left me a message with those glasses
for the next tony stark i trust you
im still not following how many lemonades have you had
he knew every mistake i ever made
he mustve known i wasnt ready for something like this
why give it to you
maybe he didnt trust me to have edith he just trusted me to pick who should
it makes much more sense he knew id do whats right
and hes not gonna give them to fury because fury would give himself edith
youre probably right
right so the world needs the next iron man
and its not me im a 16yearold kid from queens
it needs to be an adult with some experience
and thats good like tony stark like you
no peter come on no
edith hello peter
hi yeah
id like to transfer your control over to quentin beck
peter what are you doing doing the right thing
any transfer will require confirmation stark gave you the glasses
stark gave me a choice its my choice to make okay and im gonna make it
youre a soldier a leader you stopped the elementals
you saved my life you saved the world okay
hed want you to have them
waiting for confirmation
confirm
welcome to the avengers
they look good on you
thank you
its an honor
yeah
mr stark wouldve really liked you
where you headed
im gonna go find mj good luck kid
ill give you a fiftyfifty chance youre pretty awkward
yeah
see you later man see you
see that wasnt so hard
yes
somebody get this stupid costume off me
okay we got edith
get these connected to our system
toast toast toast
no this is a big win but we still got a lot of work to do
toast toast toast
yeah
okay toasts
give me that doug
to the man who brought us all together our former boss tony stark
the jester king
literally wrapped in wealth and technology
that he was unfit to wield
like the holographic system i designed
a revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications
that tony turned into a selftherapy machine
and renamed
binarily augmented retroframing or barf
oh 611 million for my little therapeutic experiment
he renamed my lifes work barf
i told him it was a mistake
that my technology could change the world
and then
he fired me
said i was
unstable
to tony to tony
next to william william
tony stark was able to build this in a cave
with a box of scraps
the integration of my illusion tech
with your weaponized drones was brilliant
powerful illusions real damage worked like a charm
and its just the beginning
thank you brother to guterman
guterman to guterman
the story you created of a soldier from another earth named quentin
fighting space monsters in europe is totally ridiculous
and apparently the kind of thing people will believe right now
i mean everybody bought it
gutes guterman
to victoria to victoria
staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site
so furys own satellites would confirm our lies
inspired idea
to janice janice
after tony died she was the one who discovered that edith
was being handed over not to us not to the defense department
but to a child
thank you to janice
and to the rest of you tony stark is gone
there is a window of opportunity and someone will step up
but these days you can be the smartest guy in the room
the most qualified and no one cares
unless youre flying around with a cape or shooting lasers from your hands
no one will even listen
well ive got a cape and lasers
with our technology and with edith
mysterio will be the greatest hero on earth
yeah
then everyone will listen
not to a boozy manchild no
not to a hormonal teenager
no
to me
and to my very wealthy crew
to us to us
to mysterio to mysterio
to peter parker to peter parker
poor kid
lets get to work

okay lets go
im glad were doing this yeah me too
to see the city a bit
they used to execute people on this bridge
they would put them in a basket and they would drown in the water
sorry its okay
theres this thing ive been wanting to talk to you about
for a while
yeah
its our last night in europe
and i had this plan that i wanted to tell you
im just gonna tell you
mj i im spiderman
what thats what you were gonna say
that youre spiderman
no im not spiderman
ive been watching you for a while now
its kind of obvious
im not spiderman
what would make you think that i was spiderman
peter washington yeah
the fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason
no i was sick remember i had my the tummy
susan yang thinks youre a male escort
what of course im not a male escort
then youre spiderman im not spiderman at all
what about tonight you snuck off and you fought that thing i saw you
you cant have seen me because im not spiderman
also on the news it was the night monkey
the night monkey yeah
thats what it said on the news
and the news never lies
night monkey okay what are you doing
well do the night monkey and spiderman use the same webs
i mean maybe
maybe hes a spider monkey who knows
were you only watching me because you thought i was spiderman
yeah
why else would i be watching you
doesnt matter just thought that maybe
what the hell was that
i dont know
what is it some kind of projector or something
yeah but its really advanced
it it looked so real
it yeah really real
wait does that mean that the elementals are fake
that doesnt make any sense because we were there right
there was fire and destruction and
who would do something like that
mysterio
i am spiderman
and ive really messed up wait youre being serious
youre 100 percent serious because its not funny
no im not joking
because i was i was only like 67 percent sure
mj so why are you here
why are you on this school trip i know you have a lot of questions
but we have to get out of here okay
okay okay i cant believe i figured it out
you took everything from me
this is for my family
pause
pause
sorry
yeah can you just fastforward to the end
yep stand by
all right fly fly fly zap zap zap
pause im not in love with this choreography but itll do
kill image
decloak drones
all right weapons
you want to weaponize yep
weapons only stand by
nice stop
something i dont know what it is its something
just dou you know what double the damage and then run it again
you want me to double it up
yeah all right
cover your ears
that is good thats good
we on schedule oh yeah
uploading software hack to edith network
with her drones well create an event big enough to cover an entire city
all right well done
make sure every drone is weaponshot we need maximum damage
that is gonna cause a lot of casualties oh yeah
more casualties more coverage i gotta cut through the static
london is a beautiful city and it will suffer but they can rebuild
if im the next iron man
i need to save the world from an avengerslevel threat
but when its new savior descends
all those casualties will be forgotten
janice youll be in position with my quickchange armor for the victory lap
of course do you wanna try
no no thats whats going on with my hand
why is that happening
oh one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector
its fine
wait and youre youre telling me this now
its its one drone
the image will be perfect i promise that projector is evidence
its going to tell people what were doing and how were doing it
i am trying to fool 7 billion people here including nick fury
who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet
if he catches on before ive killed him he will put a bullet in my head
and nobody wants a bullet in their head right
right
william can you look at me
pull up edith
hello quentin
hi honey i need a levelfive search fullresource protocol for this device
magnifying
there search everything going in and out of that building
located
shit
you know william one day
after ive had to kill peter parker because of this
i hope you remember that his blood is on your hands
i cant believe i gave beck those glasses how could i be that stupid
hes probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me
you had access to killer drones
yeah i didnt really want them especially after i almost killed brad
you almost killed brad
look i have to call mr fury and tell him that becks a fraud
but i think he tapped my phone so what are you gonna do
i need my suit and i have to go to berlin
and talk to mr fury in person
just
oh ned perfect
the costume looks great
for the costume party at the princes castle
she knows i told her
he didnt tell me i figured it out
thats cool like a long time ago
look mysterio is a fraud but he saved me and bettys lives
hes been faking the whole thing with illusion tech
yeah hes using these like hologram projectors
thats crazy
yeah
so you guys were working the case together or what
its been mostly me
ned i need you to call may get her to call mr harrington
say she wanted me to stay with family in berlin okay
got it easy
wow you guys lie with such ease
i gotta go wait wait wait the projector
youre gonna need this
dont tell anyone about this okay anyone who knows is in danger
so you know too
its cool
ive known first and ive known longer but its not a competition
excuse me do you know where nacht monkey
no wait i didnt oh man
get in
mr fury youve got a lot of explaining to do
no no no listen wait until were secure
okay
right
so is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend
hes talking about edith
i know i made a mistake and im sorry but he is not who you think he is
beck is a liar mysterio the elementals its all fake
he has some sort of illusion tech
thats how he tricked you and tricked me into giving him edith
its a projector i pulled it off the fire monster in prague
so all that death and destruction we witnessed
was created by this
no not just this i think hes using drones
well if this is true then becks very dangerous and we need to be smart
who else did you tell about this
parker parker
whats wrong its beck hes here
what hill
no its just an illu
fury
wow peter wow
i thought we were close
fury always had to die but not you
stop hiding beck
i tried to help you walk away
now youre making me do this
you told me you were just a kid
you told me you wanted to run after that girl
help me mj
oh god
peter whats going on i know this isnt real
do you though
mj mj
i dont think you know whats real peter
you need to wake up
i mean look at yourself
you are just a scared little kid in a sweat suit
i created mysterio to give the world someone to believe in
i control the truth
mysterio is the truth
if you were good enough maybe tony would still be alive
deep down you know im right
you made your choice and all you had to do was step aside
and now you have
fury
becks people are trying to find everyone who could expose him
whod you tell
i know you told someone so just tell me
okay who did you tell
who else did you tell just ned and mj from my class
maybe ned told his girlfriend betty but thats it
what
you are so gullible
what youre smart as a whip
just a
sucker

nobody could live up to tony
not even tony
tony was my best friend

oh yeah i get it
theres been nothing scientific about this science tour at all

because i saw him in the back room of a rest stop with some woman
in his underwear and hes always sneaking away
like back at the opera huh

is no one else interested in the truth
the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world

i should probably get out of here
be safe see you later
this is breaking news
we come to you with revelations about last weeks attack in london
an anonymous source provided this video
it shows quentin beck aka mysterio moments before his death
a warning you may find this video disturbing
i managed to send the elemental through the rift
but i dont think im gonna make it
spiderman attacked me for some reason
he has an army of weaponized drones stark technology
hes saying hes the only one whos gonna be the new iron man no one else
are you sure you want to commence the drone attack
there will be significant casualties do it execute them all
this shocking video was released earlier today
on the controversial news website thedailybuglenet
there you have it folks conclusive proof that spiderman
was responsible for the murder of mysterio
an interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet
and who will no doubt go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time
but thats not all folks
heres the real blockbuster brace yourselves
spidermans real spidermans real name is
spidermans name is peter parker
what the fu
you gotta tell him
it was fine
the little boy handled it
we helped
talos come off it
how was i supposed to know that the whole thing was fake
i mean that was all very convincing
the performances the illusion that costume the craftsmanship in that
this is just embarrassing for a shapeshifter fine
hey there i hope your mission is going well
we gave the glasses to parker about a week ago like you said
and it was very touching you know
really really quite touching
talos
and you know shortly after that
it really kind of went off the rails and so we need you to come back
because everyone kept asking where the avengers are
i dont know what to say to that
so youre lucky that spiderman won
everybody back to work
whos got my shoes
been a while since i was up here in front of you
maybe ill do us all a favour and just stick to the cards
theres been speculation that i was involved in the events that occurred
on the freeway and the rooftop
sorry mr stark do you honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared
despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards
yes
and this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped
with an undisclosed stark hightech powered battle
i know that its confusing
it is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely
to make wild accusations or insinuate that im a superhero
i mean lets face it im not the heroic type
a laundry list of character defects
all the mistakes ive made largely public
the truth is
i am iron man
ivan
vanya
270 at 30 knots holding steady at 15000 feet

its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me

sipping on an iced tea
because i havent come across anyone whos man enough
to go toetotoe with me on my best day
i love you tony
please its not about me
its not about you
its not even about us its about legacy
its about what we choose to leave behind for future generations
and thats why for the next year and for the first time since 1974
the best and brightest men and women
of nations and corporations the world over
will pool their resources share their collective vision
to leave behind a brighter future
its not about us
therefore what im saying if im saying anything
is welcome back to the stark expo
and now making a special guest appearance
from the great beyond to tell you what its all about
please welcome my father howard
everything is achievable through technology
better living robust health
and for the first time in human history the possibility of world peace

 how far are we from dc  dc 250 miles
mr stark could we pick up now where we left off mr stark please
 yes dear  can i have your attention
absolutely
do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon
 i do not i do not  you do not
well it depends on how you define the word weapon
 the iron man weapon  my device does not fit that description
well how would you describe it
i would describe it by defining it as what it is senator
 as  its a hightech prosthesis
that is that is
thats actually the most apt description i can make of it
its a weapon its a weapon mr stark
please if your priority was actually the wellbeing of the american citizen
my priority is to get the iron man weapon turned over to the people
 of the united states of america  well you can forget it
i am iron man the suit and i are one
to turn over the iron man suit would be to turn over myself
which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution
depending on what state youre in
 you cant have it  look im no expert
in prostitution of course not youre a senator come on
im no expert in weapons
we have somebody here who is an expert on weapons
id now like to call justin hammer our current primary weapons contractor
let the record reflect that i observed mr hammer entering the chamber
and i am wondering
if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance
absolutely im no expert i defer to you anthony
youre the wonder boy
senator if i may
i may well not be an expert but you know who was the expert
your dad howard stark
really a father to us all and to the militaryindustrial age
lets just be clear he was no flower child
he was a lion
we all know why were here in the last six months
anthony stark has created a sword with untold possibilities
and yet he insists its a shield
he asks us to trust him as we cower behind it
i wish i were comforted anthony i really do
id love to leave my door unlocked when i leave the house
but this aint canada
you know we live in a world of grave threats
threats that mr stark will not always be able to foresee
thank you
god bless iron man god bless america
that is well said mr hammer
the committee would now like to invite
lieutenant colonel james rhodes to the chamber
rhodey what
hey buddy i didnt expect to see you here
look its me im here deal with it lets move on
i just
 drop it  all right ill drop it
i have before me a complete report on the iron man weapon
compiled by colonel rhodes and colonel for the record
can you please read page 57 paragraph four
youre requesting that i read specific selections
 from my report senator  yes sir
it was my understanding that i was going to be testifying
in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner
i understand a lot of things have changed today
 so if you could just read  you do understand
that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect
 the summary of my final  just read it colonel i do thank you
very well
as he does not operate within any definable branch of government
iron man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation
and to her interests
i did however go on to summarise
that the benefits of iron man far outweigh the liabilities
 and that it would be in our interest  thats enough colonel
to fold mr stark  thats enough
into the existing chain of command senator
im not a joiner but ill consider secretary of defense if you ask nice
we can amend the hours a little bit
id like to go on and show if i may
the imagery thats connected to your report
i believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images
 to the general public at this time  with all due respect
colonel i understand
and if you could just narrate those for us wed be very grateful
lets have the images
intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos
are in fact attempts at making manned copies
of mr starks suit
this has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground
indicating that these suits are quite possibly at this moment operational
hold on one second buddy let me see something here
boy im good i commandeered your screens
i need them time for a little transparency
 now lets see whats really going on  what is he doing
if you will direct your attention to said screens
i believe thats north korea
can you turn that off take it off
iran
no grave immediate threat here is that justin hammer
how did hammer get in the game
justin youre on tv focus up
okay give me a left twist lefts good turn to the right
oh shit oh shit
wow
yeah id say most countries five 10 years away
hammer industries 20
id like to point out that that test pilot survived
i think were done is the point that hes making
 i dont think theres any reason  the point is youre welcome i guess
 for what  because im your nuclear deterrent
its working were safe america is secure
you want my property you cant have it
but i did you a big favour
ive successfully privatized world peace
what more do you want for now
i tried to play ball with these assclowns
you mr stark you buddy
were adjourned were adjourned for today
 okay  youve been a delight
my bond is with the people
and i will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself
if theres one thing ive proven
its that you can count on me to pleasure myself
wake up daddys home
welcome home sir
congratulations on the opening ceremonies
they were such a success as was your senate hearing
and may i say how refreshing it is
to finally see you in a video with your clothing on sir

ill turn you into a wine rack
how many ounces a day of this gobbledegook
am i supposed to drink
we are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms sir

blood toxicity 24
it appears that the continued use of the iron man suit
is accelerating your condition
another core has been depleted
god theyre running out quick
i have run simulations on every known element
and none can serve as a viable replacement
for the palladium core
you are running out of both time and options
unfortunately the device thats keeping you alive
is also killing you
miss potts is approaching

stop banging the car
calm down
god god

you you lose
you lose you lose stark
pretty decent tech cycles per second were a little low
you could have doubled up your rotations
you focused the repulsor energy through ionized plasma channels
its effective not very efficient
but its a passable knockoff
i dont get it a little fine tuning
you could have made a solid paycheck
you could have sold it to north korea china iran
or gone right to the black market
you look like you got friends in low places
you come from a family of thieves and butchers
and now like all guilty men
you try to rewrite your own history
and you forget all the lives the stark family has destroyed
speaking of thieves where did you get this design
my father anton vanko
well i never heard of him
my father is the reason youre alive
the reason im alive is cause you had a shot you took it
you missed
did i
if you can make god bleed
the people will cease to believe in him
and there will be blood in the water and the sharks will come
the truth all i have to do is sit here and watch
as the world will consume you
where will you be watching the world consume me from
thats right a prison cell ill send you a bar of soap
hey tony before you go
palladium in the chest painful way to die
its just unbelievable it proves that the genie is out of the bottle
and this man has no idea what hes doing
he thinks of the iron man weapon as a toy
i was at a hearing where mr stark in fact was adamant
that these suits cant exist anywhere else
dont exist anywhere else never will exist anywhere else
at least for five to 10 years
and here we are in monaco realising these suits exist now
mute
he should be giving me a medal thats the truth
 what is that  this is your inflight meal
did you just make that
yeah where do you think ive been for three hours
tony
what are you not telling me
i dont want to go home at all
lets cancel my birthday party and
were in europe lets go to venice cipriani
 remember  oh yes
its a great place to
 be healthy  i dont think this is the right time
were in kind of a mess
yeah but maybe thats why its the best time
 cause then we  well i think as the ceo
i need to show up
as ceo you are entitled to a leave
 a leave  a company retreat
 a retreat during a time like this  just a ride
well im just saying to recharge our batteries and figure it all out
not everybody runs on batteries tony
hey there he is
there he is
what an absolute pleasure welcome
oh goodness gracious
can we get the handcuffs off my friend here
forgive me im sorry im such a huge fan of yours
i didnt want to make a first impression like this
hes not an animal come on
hes a human being thank you
were fine
my name is justin hammer
id like to do some business with you please sit
dig in what do we have today jack
 we have some salmon carpaccio  salmon carpaccio
anything you want here we got it
i like my dessert first i had this flown in from san francisco
its italian though
organic ice cream
i got a sweet tooth apparently you do too for tony stark
what i saw you do to tony stark on that track
how you stepped up to him in front of god and everybody
that was wow
you spoke to me with what you did
and i know that you knew that id be listening
this is why i couldnt bear to have you shipped off
to god knows where it would have been such a waste of talent
but if i might make a suggestion
you know you dont just go and try and kill the guy
i think if i may you go after his legacy
thats what you kill
you and me we are a lot alike in a lot of ways
the only difference between you and i is that i have resources
i think if i may
you need my resources
someone behind you a benefactor
id like to be that guy
okay do you speak english because i can get a translator
i dont know have you been understanding everything im saying
very good man
 very good man  very good man

yes but the fundamentals of the company are still very very strong
 despite the events in monaco  yes of course
 the ap wants a quote  dont tell him fax them
where is he
 he doesnt want to be disturbed  hes downstairs
what happened in monaco  yes but
but his continuing erratic behaviour
may lead many people to ask themselves
can this man still protect us
iron man never stopped protecting us the events in monaco proved that
query complete sir anton vanko was a soviet physicist
who defected to the united states in 1963
however he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967
his son ivan who is also a physicist
was convicted of selling sovietera weaponsgrade plutonium to pakistan

its also an order
yes sir
good work colonel youve made your country proud
thank you sir
that thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology
no it was finished
it has never been particularly effective until i miniaturised it and put it in my
no howard said the arc reactor
was the stepping stone to something greater
he was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race
he was on to something big
something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor
look like a triplea battery
just him or was anton vanko in on this too
anton vanko is the other side of that coin
anton saw it as a way to get rich
when your father found out he had him deported
when the russians found out he couldnt deliver
they shipped his ass off to siberia
and he spent the next 20 years in a vodkafuelled rage
not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in
the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in monaco
you told me i hadnt tried everything
what do you mean i havent tried everything
what havent i tried
he said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge
to finish what he started
he said that
are you that guy are you
cause if you are then you can solve the riddle of your heart
i dont know where you get your information
but he wasnt my biggest fan
what do you remember about your dad
he was cold he was calculating
he never told me he loved me he never even told me he liked me
so its a little tough for me to digest
when youre telling me he said the whole future was riding on me
and hes passing it down i dont get that
youre talking about a guy whose happiest day
was when he shipped me off to boarding school
thats not true
well then clearly you knew my dad better than i did
as a matter of fact i did he was one of the founding members of shieid
what
 i got a 2 00  wait wait wait wait
 whats this  okay youre good right

 yeah but youre not burt  he obviously did not

funky christmas music playing

 in a one horse open sleigh
 oer the fields we go
 laughing all the way
grunts
 bells on bob tails ring
crap
 oh what fun it is to sing
 a sleighing song tonight
whirring
 jingle bells jingle bells
mechanical whirring
 jingle all the way
 oh what fun it is to ride
whirring
 in a one horse open sleigh

mechanical whirring
record scratches music stops
come on i aint scared of you

grunts
groaning
as always sir a great pleasure watching you work
tony i guess 72 hours is a long time between siestas
i didnt think it could get any worse
groaning softly
then i had to go and turn on the tv
thats when he happened
the mandarin some people call me a terrorist
man yelling indistinctly
guns firing
i consider myself a teacher
cheering
america
ready for another lesson
in 1864 in sand creek colorado the us military waited
until the friendly cheyenne braves had all gone hunting
waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind
and claim their land
39 hours ago
the ali ai salem air base in kuwait was attacked
i i i did that
a quaint military church
filled with wives and children of course
the soldiers were out on manoeuvres
the braves were away
president ems
you continue to resist my attempts to educate you sir
and now youve missed me again
men yelling
guns firing
you know who i am
you dont know where i am
and youll never see me coming
pat kiernan now that we seem to be back
lets recap some of the frightening developments
american airwaves were hijacked
the nation remains on high alert
all attempts to find the mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful
ellis central to my administrations response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource
i know him as colonel james rhodes
the american people will soon know him
as the tron patriot
and how is president ems responding
by taking the guy they call war machine
and giving him a paint job
the same suit but painted red white and blue
look at that and they also renamed him iron patriot
you know just in case the paint was too subtle
it tested well with focus groups all right
gruffly i am iron patriot it sucks
listen war machine was a little too aggressive
all right this sends a better message
sighs
so whats really going on with the mandarin
seriously can we talk about this guy
its classified information tony
okay there have been nine bombings
 nine  the public only knows about three
but heres the thing nobody can id a device
theres no bomb casings
you know i can help just ask
i got a ton of new tech i got a prehensile suit
stammering i got bomb disposal
it catches explosions in midair
whens the last time you got a good nights sleep
einstein slept three hours a year look what he did
people are concerned about you tony im concerned about you
youre going to come at me like that
no look im not trying to be a dick
tator
do you mind signing my drawing
 if richard doesnt mind chuckles
are you all right with this dick
rhodey yeah fine with me
tony  whats your name  erin
i loved you in a christmas story by the way
listen the pentagon is scared
after new york aliens come on
they need to look strong
stopping the mandarin is a priority but its not
 its not superhero business  no its not quite frankly
 i get it  its american business
thats why i said i got it

gasps what is that
its the primary somatosensory cortex its the brains pain centre
but this is what i wanted to show you
beeps
now extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here
this is essentially an empty slot and what this tells us
is that our mind
our entire dna in fact
is destined to be upgraded
wow
quiet ringing
whispers oh wait
ringing continues  uh
chimes  hello
tony  is this forehead of security  what
you know look i got a real job what do you want

as in enhanced soldiers private armies and tony is
tony tony

and then the ego steps in the obsession
and you look up
youre a long way from shore

its just a role the mandarin see its not real
then how did you get here trevor
well i um had a little problem with um substances
and i ended up doing things no two ways about it
in the street that a man shouldnt do
 next  then
they approached me about the role
and they knew about the drugs
what did they say theyd get you off them
they said theyd give me more
they gave me things
they gave me this palace they gave me plastic surgery
they gave me things
snoring

his think tank thinked it up
the pathology of a serial killer
the manipulation of western iconography
without accent ready for another lesson
blah blah blah
no
with accent of course it was my performance
that brought the mandarin to life
your performance
where people died
no they didnt
look around you the costumes green screen
honestly i wasnt on location for half this stuff
and when i was it was movie magic love

youre still going down pal

typing
tony ah
sighs okay

oh yeah with zip ties its a ball
it wasnt my idea
okay so you took killians card
i took his money

im telling you it isnt im on the street
people are going bang theyre painting the walls
maya youre kidding yourself
then help me fix it
did i do that
yes
i remember the night not the morning
is this what youve been chasing around
 you dont remember  i cant help you
you used to have a moral psychology
you used to have ideals
you wanted to help people
now look at you
i get to wake up every morning with someone who
still has their soul
get me out of here
come on
killian you know what my old man used to say to me
one of his favourite of many sayings
the early bird gets the worm but the second mouse gets the cheese
youre not still pissed off about the switzerland thing are you
how can i be pissed at you tony
im here to thank you
you gave me the greatest gift that anybodys ever given me
desperation
if you think back to switzerland
you said youd meet me on the rooftop right
well for the first 20 minutes
i actually thought youd show up
and the next hour
i considered taking that onestep shortcut to the lobby
if you know what i mean
honestly im still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse
but as i looked out over that city
nobody knew i was there nobody could see me
no one was even looking
i had a thought that would guide me for years to come
anonymity tony
thanks to you its been my mantra ever since
right
you simply rule from behind the scenes
because the second you give evil a face
a bin laden a gaddafi a mandarin
you hand the people a target
youre something else
you have met him i assume
yes sir laurence oblivier
i know hes a little over the top sometimes
its not entirely my fault he has a tenden
hes a stage actor
they say his lear was the toast of croydon wherever that is
anyway the point is
ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky
subtlety has kind of had its day
whats next for you in your world
well i wanted to repay you the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me
orbs humming
desperation
now this is live
im not sure if you can tell but at this moment
the body is trying to decide whether to accept extremis
or just give up
and if it gives up
i have to say the detonation is quite spectacular
but until that point its really just a lot of pain
clicks humming ceases
we havent even talked salary yet
what kind of perk package are you thinking of
maya let him go
hold on hold on
maya
i said let him go
what are you doing
1200 ccs a dose half of this size im dead
its times like this my temper is tested somewhat
maya give me the injector
if i die killian

what happens to you what happens if you go too hot
breathing deeply
killian the good news is
a highlevel position has just been vacated
groans
sighs
you are a maniac
no im a visionary
but i do own a maniac
and he takes the stage tonight
once we get the patriot installed

well thats great but the last time i looked

im a changed man
you can take away my house all my tricks and toys
one thing you cant take away
i am iron man
thrilling music playing
ominous music playing
tony you know and thank you by the way for listening

i mean this is what gets people sick you know
wow i had no idea you were such a good listener
to be able to share all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone
it just cuts the weight of it in half
you know its like a snake swallowing its own tail

what do you want
okay
my cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago
 about this little perfect job  no way
no no no wait this guy this guy fits your mo
no
im finished man im not going back to jail
its some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute
its a perfect scott lang mark
i dont care im out
dr pym
yes im still alive
id
perhaps that will suffice
very sorry sir please come in
is that hank pym
good morning hank
hope
would it kill you to call me dad
dr cross will be so pleased that you could find the time to join us today
more like thrilled
i was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you darren
whats the occasion
oh youll see wont he hope
were ready for you inside
ouch
i guess some old wounds never heal huh
dont worry shes in good hands
youre in for a treat
long time no see dr pym hows retirement
hows your face
after you
now before we start id like to introduce a very special guest
this companys founder and my mentor
dr hank pym
when i took over this company for dr pym
i immediately started researching a particle
that could change the distance between atoms
while increasing density and strength
why this revolutionary idea remained buried
beneath the dust and cobwebs of hanks research i couldnt tell you
but just imagine
a soldier the size of an insect
the ultimate secret weapon
an antman
thats what they called you right hank
silly i know
propaganda
tales to astonish
trumpedup bs to scare the ussr
hank will you tell our guests what you told me
every single time i asked you
was the antman real
just a tall tale
right
because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real
well i was inspired by the legend of the antman
and with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material
i thought could it be possible to shrink a person
could that be done
well its not a legend anymore
distinguished guests
i am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it
the yellowjacket
oh no
the yellowjacket is an allpurpose weapon of war
capable of altering the size of the wearer
for the ultimate combat advantage
we live in an era
in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves
are undermined by constant surveillance
its time to return to a simpler age
one where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly
to protect their interests
an allpurpose peacekeeping vessel
the yellowjacket can manage any conflict
on the geopolitical landscape
completely unseen
efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault
practical applications include surveillance
industrial sabotage
and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace
a single yellowjacket
offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions
and one day soon an army of yellowjackets
will create a sustainable environment of wellbeing around the world
the yellowjacket
so its a suit
dont be crude frank
its not a suit its a vessel
whats the matter youre not impressed
no im impressed im also concerned
imagine what our enemies could do with this tech
we should have a longer conversation about that frank
i really value your opinion
thank you for coming hope
thank you very much everybody i will escort you out now
thank you
you seem a bit shocked
darren theres a reason that i buried these secrets
so you finally admit it
we could have done this together hank but you ruined that
thats why youre the past and im the future
dont do this
dr cross
you sell to me first 20 over your asking price
i can have the cash here in two weeks
deal
we have to make our move hank
how close is he
he still cant shrink a live subject
just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all
no
i have cross complete trust
 its too dangerous  we dont have a choice
well thats not entirely true
i think i found a guy
who
daddy
peanut oh
happy birthday
im so sorry im late
i didnt know what time your party started
it was on the invitation
he didnt get an invitation
but he came anyway
well im not gonna miss my little girls birthday party
im gonna go tell mommy youre here
oh you dont
what are you doing here lang
you havent paid a dime of child support
you know right now if i wanted to i could arrest you
its good to see you too paxton
mommys so happy youre here she choked on her drink
hey look what i have for you
can i open it now
of course sweetheart its your birthday
youre my bestest friend
what is that thing
hes so ugly
i love him
can i go show my friends
of course sweetheart go ahead
youre my bestest friend
look the child support is coming all right
its just hard finding a job when you have a record
im sure youll figure it out but for now i want you out of my house
 no way its my daughters birthday  its my house
 so what its my kid  scott
you cant just show up here you know that come on
its a birthday party
yeah i know but you cant just show up
shes my daughter
you dont know the first thing about being a father
maggie i tell you this as a friend and as the first love of my life
your fianc is an asshat
hes not an asshat
 hey watch your language okay  what language i said hat
stop it
really maggie that guy
come on you could marry anyone you want
and you have to get engaged to a cop
at least hes not a crook
im trying okay ive changed im straight
i had a job and
i wanna provide
i had a lot of time to think about it and i love her
so much
ive missed so much time and i wanna be a part of her life
what do i do
get an apartment
get a job pay child support
and then we will talk about visitation i promise
youre her hero scott
just be the person that she already thinks you are
im sorry you have such deep concerns about the yellowjacket frank
yeah well uh
unfortunately we cant just do whatever we want
itd be nice though right
but there are laws
what laws of man
the laws of nature transcend the laws of man
and ive transcended the laws of nature
darren i dont think you understand
hmm
we still havent worked out all the bugs
goodbye frank
thank you
you know ive been thinking a lot about gratitude lately
and today during my morning meditation
an interesting thought occurred to me and i think it might apply to you too
hows that
gratitude can be forgiveness
ive spent years carrying around my anger for hank pym
i devoted my genius to him
i could have worked anywhere
i chose my mentor poorly
you didnt even have a choice
he never believed in you
its a shame what we had to do but he forced us to do it didnt he
but we shouldnt be angry we should be grateful
because his failures as a mentor
as a father
forced us to spread our wings
youre a success darren
you deserve everything coming your way
ooh
stop cheating
hey whats up hotshot
maybe he didnt hear you
how was the party
 tell me about that tip  what
i wanna know about that tip
oh baby its on its so on right now
calm down all right i just need to know where it came from
its gotta be airtight
okay
i was at a wine tasting with my cousin ernesto
which was mainly reds and you know i dont like reds man
but there was a ros that saved the day it was delightful
and then he tells me about this girl emily that we used to kick it with
it was actually the first pair of boobs i ever touched
its the wrong details
it has nothing to do with the story
go
so uh he tells me that shes working as a housekeeper now right
and shes dating this dude carlos whos a shot caller from across the bay
and she tells him about the dude that shes cleaning for
right that hes like this bigshot ceo
that is all retired now but hes loaded
and so carlos and ernesto are on the same softball team
and they get to talking right
and here comes the good part carlos says yo man
this guys got a bigass safe just sitting in the basement just chilling
of course ernesto comes to me because he knows i got mad thieving skills
of course i ask him
did emily tell carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was
and he says nah dawg
all she said is that its superlegit
and whatevers in it its gotta be good
what
old man have safe
and hes gone for a week
all right theres an old man hes got a safe
and hes gone for a week
lets just work with that
you know what im saying
landlines cut cell signals jammed
no one will be making for distress call tonight
comm check
 check  check
hey if the job goes bad you know i got your back right
dont worry
its not gonna happen
i love it when he gets cocky
damn
alarm is dead
nice
all right im moving through the house
theres a fingerprint lock on the door
its got what ernesto didnt tell me nothing about that
aw man are we screwed
not necessarily
im in
no alarms have been triggered hes in like the flynn
oh man
what is it
well they werent kidding this safe is serious
how serious are we talking scotty
its a carbondale
its from 1910
made from the same steel as the titanic
wow
can you crack it
well heres the thing it doesnt do so well in the cold
remember what that iceberg did
yeah man it killed dicaprio
killed everybody
did not kill the old lady
she still throw the jewel into the oceans
what are you doing
i poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen
ice expands metal doesnt
 what are you doing now  waiting
waiting
nice
what is it cash jewels
 theres nothing here  what did you say
 its a suit  what
its an old motorcycle suit
theres no cash no jewelry nothing
no
its a bust
im really sorry scotty
i know you needed to score
i thought we were using mice
whats the difference
commence experiment 34c organic atomic reduction
darren maybe we should think
shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology
i cant go to the buyers with half a breakthrough
experiment 34c results
negative
sanitize the work station bring in subject 35c
why would you lock this up
this is so weird
scotty whats up man
i wonder what is this
the world sure seems different from down here doesnt it scott
what who said that
luis down here
its a trial by fire scott or in this case
water
guess youre tougher than you thought
oh i dont want to see this
luis
son of a
what the hell
not bad for a test drive
keep the suit ill be in touch
no no no thank you
get down on the ground
you are under arrest
no i didnt steal anything i was returning something i stole
oh
dont move
you know you almost had us convinced
that you were gonna change your ways
they were really rooting for you
its gonna break their hearts
 you got a visitor  who
your lawyer
my lawyer
i told you id be in touch scott
im starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell
oh man
sit down
sir im sorry i stole the suit
i dont even wanna know why you have it
maggie was right about you
how do you know about
no wonder shes trying to keep you away from cassie
the moment things get hard
you turn right back to crime
the way i see it you have a choice
you can either spend the rest of your life in prison
or go back to your cell
and await further instructions
i dont understand
no i dont expect you to
but you dont have many options right now and quite frankly
neither do i
why do you think i let you steal that suit in the first place
what
second chances dont come around all that much
so next time you think you might see one
i suggest you take a real close look at it
youre my bestest friend
are you sure you dont want a different toy
no i love this one
okay well get some sleep i love you
 mommy  hmm
is daddy a bad man
i heard some grownups say hes bad
no
daddy just gets confused sometimes you know
smart choice you actually listened for once
under the door
okay where to now
 hang tight  oh god
what what
where the hell did he go
i have no idea he just vanished
set up a fiveblock perimeter now
get back get back
scott these are my associates
is that a camera on an ant
yeah sure why not
wheres the car
no car weve got wings
incoming
put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax
 how safe is  just get on the damn ant scott
why am i on a police car shouldnt i not be on a police car
so they can give you a lift past their fiveblock perimeter
all right
 now whats the next move  hang on tight
oh this is easy im getting the hang of this
yank up to go up its like a horse
youre throwing 247 off balance
wait his name is 247
he doesnt have a name he has a number scott
do you have any idea how many ants there are
whoa
maybe its maybe its 248
no no vertigo vertigo
 no i think its 247  wait
hang on tight
i think im getting the hang of this
i am controlling 247 he is not listening to you
what
 can i make one little request  no
stop 247 time out time out
time out
all right hold on
just wait whoa
what happens if i throw up in this helmet
its my helmet scott you do not throw up
lets set her down all right
im getting lightheaded
hang on scott
im getting a little light
i need a snooze button
hit me in 5 minutes
hello
who are you
have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time
yes
why
because the last time you were here you stole something
oh oh
hey look
whoa
paraponera clavata
giant tropical bullet ants
ranked highest on the schmidt pain index
theyre here to keep an eye on you when i cant
dr pyms waiting for you downstairs
who
hey
um whose pajamas are these
how am i supposed to do this
all right just one step at a time
ugh
you dont bite me i dont step on you deal
i could take down the servers and cross wouldnt even know it
we dont need this guy
i assume that youve already met my daughter hope
i did shes great
she doesnt think that we need you
we dont we can do this ourselves
i go to all this effort to let you steal my suit
and then hope has you arrested
okay we can try this and when he fails ill do it myself
shes a little bit anxious
it has to do with this job
which judging by the fact that youre sitting opposite me
i take it that youre interested in
what job
would you like some tea
uh sure
i was very impressed with
how you managed to get past my security system
freezing that metal was particularly clever
were you watching me
scott ive been watching you for a while
ever since you robbed vista corp
oh excuse me
burgled vista corp
vistas security system was one of the most advanced in the business
it was supposed to be unbeatable
but you beat it
would you like some sugar
yeah thanks
you know what im okay
how do you make them do that
ants can lift objects 50 times their weight
they build farm they cooperate with each other
right but how do you make them do that
i use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center
i speak to them
i can go anywhere hear anything
and see everything
and still know absolutely nothing
im late to meet cross
uh dr pym
you dont need to raise your hand scott
sorry i just have one question
who are you who is she what the hells going on
and can i go back to jail now
come with me
40 years ago i created a formula that altered atomic relative distance
huh
i learned how to change the distance between atoms
thats what powers the suit
thats why it works
wow
 whoa  but it was dangerous
it was too dangerous
so i hid it from the world
and thats when i switched gears and i started my own company
pym tech
yes
i took on a young protg called darren cross
darren cross
hes a big deal
but before he was a big deal he was my assistant
i thought i saw something in him the son i never had perhaps
he was brilliant but as we became close
he began to suspect that i wasnt telling him everything
he heard rumors about what was called the pym particle
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula
but i wouldnt help him
so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company
how could he do that
the boards chairman is my daughter hope
she was the deciding vote
but she came back to me
when she saw how close cross was to cracking my formula
the process is highly volatile
if one isnt protected by a specialized helmet
it can affect the brains chemistry
i dont think darren realizes this
and you know hes not the most stable guy to begin with
so what do you want from me
scott i believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption
do you
i do
if you can help me
i promise i can help you be with your daughter again
now are you ready to redeem yourself
absolutely
my days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done
what do you want me to do
i want you to break into a place and steal some shit
are you gonna be home for dinner tonight
uh yeah ill pick something up text me
okay good news
uh i dont know its news
are you trying to find my daddy
yeah i am sweetheart
i just want your daddy to be safe
hope you dont catch him
this isnt the first time these guys
have tried to get their hands on gamechanging weaponry
thats mitchell carson exhead of defense at shield
presently in the business of toppling governments
he always wanted my tech
and now unless we break in and steal the yellowjacket
and destroy all the data
darren cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world
i think our first move should be calling the avengers
i spent half my life
trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a stark
im sure as hell not gonna handdeliver it to one now
this is not some cute technology like the iron man suit
this could change the texture of reality
besides theyre probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky
okay then why dont you just send the ants
scott they are ants
ants they can do a lot of things but they still need a leader
somebody that could infiltrate a place thats designed to prevent infiltration
hank im a thief all right i mean im a good thief but this is insane
hes right hank and you know it
youve seen the footage you know what cross is capable of
i was against using him when we had months
and now we have days
im wearing the suit
absolutely not
i know the facility inside and out i know how cross thinks
i know this mission better than anybody here
we need you close to cross otherwise this mission cannot work
 we dont have time to screw around  hope please listen to me
he is a criminal im your daughter
no
shes right hank
im not your guy
why dont you wear the suit
you think i dont want to
i cant
i spent years wearing it
and it took a toll on me
youre our only option
before hope lost her mother
she used to look at me like i was the greatest man in the world
and now she looks at me and theres just disappointment
its too late for me
but not for you
this is your chance
the chance to earn that look in your daughters eyes
to become the hero that she already thinks you are
its not about saving our world
its about saving theirs
damn that was a good speech
scott
i need you to be the antman
in the right hands
the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic
the suit has power the man harnesses that power
you need to be skillful agile and above all
you need to be fast
you should be able to shrink and grow
on a dime
so your size always suits your needs
now dive through the keyhole scott
you charge big you dive small then you emerge big
ow
ahhh
ow
useless
when youre small energys compressed
so you have the force of a 200pound man
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide youre like a bullet
you punch too hard you kill someone too soft its a love tap
in other words you have to know how to punch
i was in prison for three years i know how to punch
show me
 terrible  you wanna show me how to punch
show me
thats how you punch
 shes been looking forward to this  no kidding
hope trained in martial arts at a difficult time
oh by difficult time he means when my mother died
we lost her in a plane crash
its bad enough you wont tell me how she died
could you please stop telling me that lie
were working here
all right princess lets get back to work
were you going for the hand
you know i think this regulator is holding me back
do not screw with the regulator
if that regulator is compromised
you would go subatomic
what does that mean
it means that you would enter a quantum realm
what does that mean
it means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant
as you shrink for all eternity
everything that you know
and love
gone forever
cool yeah if it aint broke
youve learned about the suit
but youve yet to learn about your greatest allies
the ants
loyal brave
and your partners on this job
paratrechina longicornis commonly known as crazy ants
theyre lightning fast and can conduct electricity
which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics
youre not so crazy
hey
youre cute
that was a lot scarier a second ago
it looks like the futures lab has its own isolated power supply
theres a security guard posted around the clock
well need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems
okay whos next
paraponera clavata
i know bullet ants right
number 1 on the schmidt pain index
hey guys remember me from the bedroom
the yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed
and the only access point is a tube
we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter
why do i have a sick feeling in my stomach
the tube is protected by a laser grid
and we can only power that down for 15 seconds
youre gonna need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers
retrieve the suit and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on
camponotus pennsylvanicus
alternatively known as a carpenter ant
ideal for ground and air transport
wait a minute i know this guy
im gonna call him antthony
thats good thats very good
because this time youre really gonna have to learn how to control him
tell them to put the sugar in the teacup
aw you okay did i hurt
hank wants you outside for target practice
the suit has no weapons so i made you these discs
red shrinks
blue enlarges
solenopsis mandibularis
known for their bite
the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects
they are handy to get you in and out of difficult places
you can do it scott come on
theyre not listening to me
you have to commit you have to mean it
no shortcuts no lies
throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good hope
we dont have time for coddling
our focus should be on helping scott
really
is that where our focus should be
hope
i dont know why i came to you in the first place
we cant do this without her
oh god
you gotta lock your doors
i mean really theres some weird folks in this neighborhood
do you think this is a joke
do you have any idea what hes asking you to risk
you have a daughter
im doing this for her
you know when my mother died i didnt see him for two weeks
he was in grief
yeah so was i and i was seven
and he never came back not in any way that counted
he just sent me off to boarding school
you know i thought
with all thats at stake
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace
but even now he still wants to shut me out
he doesnt wanna shut you out he trusts you
then why are you here
it proves that he loves you
hope look at me
im expendable
thats why im here
you must have realized that by now
i mean its why im in the suit and youre not
he would rather lose this fight than lose you
anyway
you know i didnt know you had a daughter
when i called the cops on you
whats her name
cassie
its a pretty name
you have to clear your mind scott you have to make your thoughts precise
thats how it works
think about cassie
about how badly you want to see her and use that to focus
open your eyes
and just think about what you want the ants to do
thats good
your mother convinced me
to let her join me on my missions
they called her the wasp
she was born to it
and theres not a day that goes by
that i dont regret having said yes
it was 1987
separatists had hijacked a soviet missile silo in kursk
and launched an icbm at the united states
the only way to the internal mechanics
was through solid titanium
i knew i had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile
but my regulator had sustained too much damage
your mother
she didnt hesitate
janet no
she turned off her regulator
and went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb
and she was gone
your mom died a hero
and i spent the next 10 years
trying to learn all i could about the quantum realm
you were trying to bring her back
but all i learned was we know nothing
its not your fault
she made her choice
but why didnt you tell me that sooner
i was trying to protect you
i lost your mother
i didnt mean to lose you too
im sorry
this is awesome
its awesome you know
you guys are breaking down walls youre healing
its important
i ruined the moment didnt i
yes you did yes
im going to make some tea
nailed it
thats a good boy antthony
the final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion
its freezing
you couldnt make a suit with a flannel lining
you must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy
its a device that i invented during my shield days
we need it to counteract the transmission blockers
that cross installed in the futures vault
its currently collecting dust
in one of howard starks old storage facilities in upstate new york
should be a piece of cake
youre over the target area
disengage now scott
squadron a go
b go
c go
all right antthony please dont drop me this time
oh it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this
stay calm
guys we might have a problem
hank didnt you say this was some old warehouse
its not
you son of a bitch
 scott get out of there  abort
abort now
no its okay it doesnt look like anyones home
antthony get me to the roof
hes gonna lose the suit
hes gonna lose his life
all right im on the roof of the target building
somebodys home scott
whats going on down there sam
its the falcon
i had a sensor trip but im not seeing anything
wait a second
abort scott abort now
its okay he cant see me
i can see you
he can see me
hi im scott
did he just say hi im scott
 what are you doing here  first off im a big fan
appreciate it so who the hell are you
im antman
antman
what you havent heard of me
no you wouldnt have heard of me
you wanna tell me what you want
i was hoping i could grab a piece of technology
just for a few days im gonna return it
i need it to save the world you know how that is
i know exactly how that is
located the breach
 bringing him in  sorry about this
what the hell are you doing
breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech
sorry
look im sorry about this sorry
thats enough
antthony a little help
ive lost visual
hes inside my pack
sorry
you seem like a really great guy
its really important to me that cap never finds out about this
that was completely irresponsible and dangerous
you jeopardized everything
you got it
well done
wait a minute
did you just compliment me
 he did didnt he  kind of sounded like he did
i was good wasnt i
hey how about the fact that i fought an avenger and didnt die
let us not dwell on the past
we gotta finish our planning
dont mind him
you did good
darren
how the hell did you get in here
you left the front door open hank
its official
youre old
the plans
he will kill him
well to what do i owe this pleasure
i have good news
really
whats that
pym tech the company you created
is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world
were anticipating 15 billion in sales tomorrow alone
youre welcome
i know this is odd but id like you to be there
this is my moment i want you to see it
sure darren yeah sure
ill be there
what did you see in me
i dont know what you mean
all those years ago you picked me
what did you see
i saw myself
then why did you push me away
because i saw too much of myself
he knows hes baiting you
we have to call it off
were all taking risks
what if he saw me here
he didnt theres no way
how do you know that
darren hi
hope where are you right now
im at home why
i just saw hank
i still get nothing but contempt from him
dont let him rile you up hes just a senile old man
we need to start everyone working around the clock
get the assembly line up and running
and im tripling security
full sensors at all entrances
and exterior air vents fitted with steel micromesh
great good idea
thank you hope im so lucky to have you on my team
hes tripling security hes lost his mind and hes onto you
but he is not onto you
hes adding full body scanners to all entrances
and closing exterior vents
how are we gonna get scott inside
the water main
you cant add security to a water main
the pressure is too strong but if we can decrease it
thats how i get in
somebody would have to reach the buildings control center
to change the water pressure
hank and i will be beside cross how are we supposed to do that
so we expand our team
what do we need
a fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system
somebody else to hack in to the power supply
and kill the laser grid
and a getaway guy
no no no no no not those three wombats no way
thank you for the coffee maam
its not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back
because we just robbed you
you know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine right
two smoothie machines
are you sure they can handle this
oh we can handle it were professionals
youll forgive us if were not instilled with confidence
well hey everybody just kick back and relax a little bit man
we know our business
we broke into this spookyass house didnt we
i let you
well one could say that i let you let me
 look its okay they can handle this  yeah we can handle it
 you got their credentials  hes in the system
 im in the system  youre in the system
the system
yeah were doomed
all right
theres something you guys need to see
when you get to this corner
theres gonna be three offices on your left side
damn
whoa thats so cool bro
now look this is gonna get weird all right
its pretty freaky but its safe theres no reason to be scared
oh no no daddy dont get scared
 really  yeah
good
this is the work of gypsies
thats witchcraft
wow thats amazing
thats like some david copperfield shit
thats some kind of wizardry
this is sorcery
howd you do that bro
dont freak out look at your shoulder
ahhh
get off get off
wait i thought daddy didnt get scared
i gave them each half a xanax
and hank explained the science of the suit to them
they fell right asleep
hey look i wanna thank you for
no please dont
were all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us
im just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off
hey thank you you know for that pep talk
you know the honest truth is i actually went from despising you
to almost liking you
you really should write poetry
get some sleep scott

trusted even more than me
scott lang
a martyr
who took on the system and paid the price
losing his family and his only daughter in the process
exactly your kind of guy hank
he escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how
and then he disappears magically
despite having no money to his name
and now he brings me the antman suit
the only thing that can rival my creation
darren dont do this
if you sell to these men
its gonna be chaos
i already have
and for twice the price

but you know me im more like a neocubist kind of guy right
but there was this one rothko that was sublime bro oh my god
 luis  okay sorry sorry

ignacios like for real
and shes like yeah you know what i cant tell you who my contact is
because he works with the avengers

like he comes up to her and says
yo im looking for this dude whos new on the scene
whos flashing his fresh tack
whos got like bomb moves right who you got
and shes like well we got everything nowadays we got a guy who jumps
we got a guy who swings we got a guy who crawls up the walls
you gotta be more specific

and im like damn i got all nervous cause id keep mad secrets for you bro
so i asked ignacio
did the badass tell the stupidfine writer chick
to tell you to tell me because im tight with antman
that hes looking for him
and whatd he say
he said yes
theres something i want to show you
i realized you cant destroy power
all you can do is make sure that its in the right hands
this is an advanced prototype
that your mother and i worked on together
she never got to use it
but now i realize that we were we were working on it for you
maybe its time we finished it
its about damn time
hey cap
this would have been a lot easier a week ago
 if we call tony  he wont believe us
even if he did
who knows if the accords will let him help
were on our own
maybe not
i know a guy
master kaecilius
that ritual will bring you only sorrow
hypocrite
challenge round billy
oh come on billy youve got to be messing with me
no doctor
feels so good chuck mangione 1977
honestly billy you said this one would be hard
 ha its 1978  no billy
while feels so good may have charted in 1978
the album was released in december of 1977
no wikipedia says its a nineteen
check again
where do you store
all this useless information
useless
the man charted a top 10 hit with a flugelhorn
status billy
1977
 oh please  i hate you
oh
feels so good doesnt it
oh i got this stephen
youve done your bit go ahead well close up
what is it
gsw
its amazing you kept him alive
apneic failed the brain stem test
and the apnea reflex test
i think i found the problem doctor palmer
you left a bullet in his head
thanks its impinging on the medulla
i needed a specialist nic diagnosed brain death
something about that doesnt feel right to me
we have to run
doctor west
what are you doing hey
organ harvest hes a donor
slow down i did not agree to that
i dont need you to weve already called brain death
prematurely we need to get him prepped
for suboccipital craniotomy
not gonna let you operate on a dead man
what do you see
 a bullet  a perfect bullet
its been hardened you harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony
a toxic metal and thats leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid
rapid onset central nervous system shutdown
we gotta go
the patients not dead but he is dying
still want to harvest his organs
 ill assist you  no
doctor palmer will assist me
thank you
image guidance stat
we dont have time for that
you cant do it freehand
i can and i will
this isnt a time for showing off strange
how about 10 minutes ago
when you called the wrong time of death
cranial nerves intact
doctor west cover your watch
you know you didnt have to humiliate him in front of everyone
i didnt have to save his patient either
but i sometimes just cant help myself
nic is a great doctor
you came to me
yeah well i needed a second opinion
you had a second opinion
what you needed was a competent one
well all the more reason
why you should be my neurosurgeon on call
you could make such a difference
i cant work in your butcher shop
hey
im fusing transected spinal cords
im stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system
the work im doing is gonna save thousands for years to come
in er you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun
yeah youre right
in er were only saving lives
theres no fame theres no uh
cnn interviews
i guess ill just have to stick with nic
whoa wait a minute
youre not you guys arent
what
sleeping together sorry i thought that was implicit in my disgust
explicit actually
no i have a very strict rule against dating colleagues
oh really
i call it the strange policy
oh well good im glad somethings named after me
i invented a laminectomy procedure
and yet somehow no one seems to want to call it the strange technique
we invented that technique
regardless im very flattered by your policy
im talking tonight at a neurological society dinner
come with me
another speaking engagement
so romantic
you used to love coming to those things with me
we had fun together
no you had fun
they werent about us they were about you
not only about me
stephen everything is about you
maybe we could hyphenate
strangepalmer technique
palmerstrange
billy
what have you got for me
ive got a 35yearold air force colonel
crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor
midthoracic burst fracture
yeah well i could help
but so could 50 other people
find me something worth my time
i have a 68yearold female with an advanced brain stem glioma
yeah you want me to screw up my perfect record
definitely not
how about a 22yearold female
with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia
struck by lightning
mmm that does sound interesting
can you send me the
got it
hey
its okay its gonna be okay
what did they do
they rushed you in a chopper
but it took a little while to find you
the golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car
what did they do
11 stainless steel pins in the bones
multiple torn ligaments
severe nerve damage in both hands
you were on the table for 11 hours
look at these fixators
no one could have done better
i could have done better
no
give your body time to heal
youve ruined me
how long until i can take
doctor strange
those tissues are still healing
so speed it up
pass a stent down the brachial artery into the radial artery
its possible
experimental and expensive but possible
all i need is possible
up
up
show me your strength
this is useless
its not useless man you can do this
all right answer me this bachelors degree
have you ever known anyone with nerve damage
this severe to do this
and actually recover
one guy yeah
factory accident broke his back
paralyzed his leg wasted away
he had pain in his shoulder
from the wheelchair
he came in three times a week
then one day he stopped coming
i thought he was dead
a few years later he walked past me on the street
 walked  yeah walked
bullshit show me his file
itll take me a while to pull the files from the archive
but if it proves your arrogant ass wrong
worth it
i looked at all your research
i read all the papers youve sent
its not gonna work
i dont think you realize
 how severe the damages are  heres the thing
the best have tried and failed
i understand heres the thing
what you want from me is impossible stephen
come on
ive got my own reputation to consider
 etienne wait no  i cant help you
no no wait
hey
he wont do it
hes a hack
there is a new procedure in tokyo
they culture donor stem cells
and then harvesting them
and then 3d printing a scaffold
if i could get a loan together
stephen
a small loan just 200000
youve always spent money as fast as you could make it
but now youre spending money you dont even have
maybe its time to consider stopping
no now is exactly the time not to stop
because you see im not getting any better
but this isnt medicine anymore
this is mania
some things just cant be fixed
 life without my work  ls still life
this isnt the end
there are other things that can give your life meaning
like what like you
this is the part where you apologize
this is the part where you leave
fine i cant watch you do this to yourself anymore
oh too difficult for you is it
yes it is
it breaks my heart to see you this way
 no dont pity me  im not pitying you
oh yeah then what are you doing here
bringing cheese and wine like were old friends going for a picnic
we are not friends christine
we were barely lovers
but you just love a sob story dont you
is that what i am to you now
poor stephen strange charity case
he finally needs me
another dreg of humanity for you to work on
patch him up and send him back into the world
hearts just humming
you care so much dont you
goodbye stephen
all the way here we go
lets go all day all day
yeah all day
come on man wheres the competition
talk a lot
jonathan pangborn
c7c8 spinal cord injury complete
who are you
paralyzed from the midchest down
partial paralysis in both hands
 i dont know you  im stephen strange
im a neurosurgeon was a neurosurgeon
actually you know what man i do know you
i came to your office once you refused to see me
i never got past your assistant
you were untreatable
no glory for you in that right
you came back from a place theres no way back from
im trying to find my own way back
pangborn are you in or you out
all right
id given up on my body
i thought my minds the only thing i have left
i should at least try to elevate that
so i sat with gurus
and sacred women
strangers carried me to mountaintops to see holy men
and finally
i found my teacher
and my mind was elevated
and my spirit deepened
and somehow
your body healed
yes
there were deeper secrets to learn there
but i didnt have the strength to receive them
i chose to settle for my miracle and i came back home
the place youre looking for is called kamartaj
but the cost there is high
how much
im not talking about money
good luck
lets ball all right ball up
uh kamartaj
you know where kamartaj is
kamartaj
kamartaj
okay
look guys i dont have any money
your watch
no please its all i have left
your watch
all right
youre looking for kamartaj
really
sure we got the right place
that one looks a little more kamartajey
i once stood in your place
and i too was disrespectful
so might i offer you some advice
forget everything you think you know
all right
the sanctuary of our teacher
the ancient one
the ancient one
whats his real name
right
forget everything i think i know sorry
um thank you for whoa
okay thats a thing
thank you for
hello
oh thank you
and thank you
uh thank you
ancient one for seeing me
youre very welcome
the ancient one
thank you master mordo thank you master hamir
mr strange
uh doctor actually
well no not anymore surely
isnt that why youre here
youve undergone many procedures
 seven right  yeah
its good tea
yes
did you heal a man named pangborn
a paralyzed man
in a way
you helped him to walk again
yes
how did you correct a complete c7c8 spinal cord injury
well i didnt correct it
he couldnt walk
i convinced him that he could
youre not suggesting it was psychosomatic
when you reattach a severed nerve
is it you who heals it back together or the body
its the cells
the cells are only programmed
to put themselves back together in very specific ways
right
what if i told you that your own body could be convinced
to put itself back together in all sorts of ways
youre talking about cellular regeneration
thats bleeding edge medical tech
is that why youre working here
without a governing medical board
just how experimental is your treatment
quite
so youve figured out a way
to reprogram nerve cells to selfheal
no mr strange
i know how to reorient the spirit
to better heal the body
 the spirit to heal the body  thats right
no all right
how do we do that
where do we start
 dont like that map  oh no
its really good its just ive seen it before
in gift shops
and what about this one
 acupuncture great  yeah
what about that one
showing me an mri scan i do not believe this
each of those maps was drawn up by someone
who could see in part but not the whole
i spent my last dollar getting here oneway ticket
and youre talking to me about healing through belief
youre a man looking at the world through a keyhole
youve spent your whole life
trying to widen that keyhole
to see more to know more
now on hearing that it can be widened
in ways you cant imagine
you reject the possibility
no i reject it because i do not believe in fairy tales
about chakras or energy
or the power of belief
there is no such thing as spirit
we are made of matter and nothing more
youre just another tiny momentary speck
within an indifferent universe
you think too little of yourself
oh you think you see through me do you
well you dont
but i see through you
what did you just do to me
i pushed your astral form out of your physical form
whats in that tea
psilocybin lsd
its just tea
with a little honey
what just happened
for a moment you entered the astral dimension
the what
a place where the soul exists apart from the body
why are you doing this to me
to show you just how much you dont know
open your eye
oh shit
oh god oh god no
no no no
whats happening
this isnt real
his heart rate is getting dangerously high
he looks all right to me
you think you know how the world works
you think that this material universe is all there is
what is real
what mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses
at the root of existence
mind and matter meet
thoughts shape reality
on
this universe is only one of an infinite number
worlds without end
some benevolent and life giving
others filled with malice and hunger
dark places
where powers older than time lie ravenous
and waiting
who are you in this vast multiverse mr strange
have you seen that before in a gift shop
teach me
no
no
no
no no no
no
open the door please
thank you masters
you think i was wrong to cast him out
5 hours later hes still on your doorstep
theres a strength to him
stubbornness arrogance ambition
ive seen it all before
he reminds you of kaecilius
i cannot lead another gifted student to power
only to lose him to the darkness
you didnt lose me
i wanted the power to defeat my enemies
you gave me the power to defeat my demons
and to live within the natural law
we never lose our demons mordo
we only learn to live above them
kaecilius still has the stolen pages
if he deciphers them he could bring ruin
upon us all
there may be dark days ahead
perhaps kamartaj could use a man like strange
dont shut me out
i havent got anywhere else to go
thank you
bathe
rest
meditate
if you can
the ancient one will send for you
whats this my mantra
the wifi password
were not savages
the language of the mystic arts
is as old as civilization
the sorcerers of antiquity
called the use of this language spells
but if that word offends your modern sensibilities
you can call it a program
the source code that shapes reality
we harness energy
drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse
to cast spells
to conjure shields
and weapons
to make magic
but even if my fingers could do that
my hands would just be waving in the air
how do i get from here to there
how did you get to reattach severed nerves
and put a human spine back together bone by bone
study and practice years of it
hey
mr strange
uh stephen please
 and you are  wong
wong
just wong
like adele
or aristotle
drake
bono
eminem
the book of the invisible sun
astronomia nova
codex imperium
key of solomon
you finished all of these
yup
come with me
all right
this section is for masters only
but at my discretion others may use it
you should start with maxims primer
hows your sanskrit
im fluent in google translate
vedic classical sanskrit
what are those
the ancient ones private collection
so theyre forbidden
no knowledge in kamartaj is forbidden
only certain practices
those books are far too advanced
for anyone other than the sorcerer supreme
this ones got pages missing
thats the book of cagliostro
a study of time
one of the rituals was stolen by a former master
the zealot kaecilius
just after he strung up the former librarian
and relieved him of his head
i am now the guardian of these books
so if a volume from this collection should be stolen again
id know it
and youd be dead before you ever left the compound
what if its just overdue
any late fees i should know about maiming perhaps
people used to think that i was funny
did they work for you
all right well its been lovely talking to you
thank you for the books
and for the horrifying story
and for the threat upon my life
we will now receive the power
to destroy the one who betrayed us
the one who betrays the world
mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts
they allow us to travel throughout the multiverse
all you need to do is focus
visualize
see the destination in your mind
look beyond the world in front of you
imagine every detail
the clearer the picture the quicker and easier
the gateway will come
and stop
i would like a moment alone with mr strange
of course
my hands
its not about your hands
how is this not about my hands
master hamir
thank you master hamir
you cannot beat a river into submission
you have to surrender to its current
and use its power as your own
i control it by surrendering control
that doesnt make any sense
not everything does not everything has to
your intellect has taken you far in life
but it will take you no further
surrender stephen
silence your ego
and your power will rise
come with me
wait
 is this  everest
beautiful
yeah right beautiful
freezing but beautiful
at this temperature
a person can last for 30 minutes
before suffering permanent loss of function
great
but youll likely go into shock within the first two
 what  surrender stephen
no
hows our new recruit
we shall see
any second now
oh no not again
maybe i should
stephen
wong
what do you want strange
books on astral projection
youre not ready for that
try me beyonc
oh come on youve heard of her
shes a huge star right
do you ever laugh
oh come on  just give me the book
no
once in this room
you begged me to let you learn
now im told you question every lesson
preferring to teach yourself
once in this room you told me to open my eye
now im being told to blindly accept rules
that make no sense
like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library
wong told on me
youre advancing quickly with your sorcery skills
you need a safe space to practice your spells
you are now inside the mirror dimension
ever present but undetected
the real world isnt affected by what happens here
we use the mirror dimension to train surveil
and sometimes to contain threats
you dont wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring
hold on sorry what do you mean threats
learning of an infinite multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers
if i told you everything else that you dont already know
youd run from here in terror
so just how ancient is she
no one knows the age of the sorcerer supreme
only that shes celtic and never talks about her past
you follow her even though you dont know
i know shes steadfast
but unpredictable
merciless yet kind
she made me what i am
trust your teacher
and dont lose your way
like kaecilius
thats right
you knew him
when he first came to us
hed lost everyone he ever loved
he was a grieving broken man searching for answers in the mystic arts
a brilliant student but he was proud headstrong
he questioned the ancient one rejected her teaching
he left kamartaj
his disciples followed him like sheep
seduced by false doctrine
and he stole the forbidden ritual right
yes
what did it do
no more questions
whats that
thats a question
this is a relic
some magic is too powerful to sustain
so we imbue objects with it
allowing them to take the strain we cannot
this is the staff
of the living tribunal
there are many relics
the wand of watoomb
the vaulting boots of valtorr
really just roll off the tongue dont they
 when do i get my relic  when youre ready
i think im ready
youre ready when the relic decides youre ready
for now
conjure a weapon
all right
fight
fight like your life depended on it
because one day
it may
wong
okay
first open the eye of agamotto
all right
oh my
what if
dormammu
the dark dimension
eternal life
 what the  stop
tampering with continuum probabilities is forbidden
i was just doing exactly what it said in the book
what did the book say
about the dangers of performing that ritual
i dont know i hadnt gotten to that part yet
temporal manipulations can create branches in time
unstable dimensional openings
spatial paradoxes time loops
you wanna get stuck reliving the same moment
over and over forever
or never having existed at all
really should put the warnings before the spell
your curiosity could have gotten you killed
you werent manipulating the spacetime continuum
you were breaking it
we do not tamper with natural law
we defend it
how did you even do that
hmm
where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it
ive got a photographic memory
thats how i got my md and phd at the same time
what you just did
takes more than a good memory
you were born for the mystic arts
and yet my hands still shake
for now yes
not forever
were not prophets
when are you gonna start telling me what we are
while heroes like the avengers
protect the world from physical dangers
we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats
the ancient one is the latest in a long line
of sorcerers supreme
going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts
the mighty agamotto
same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed
agamotto built three sanctums in places of power
where great cities now stand
that door leads to the hong kong sanctum
that door to the new york sanctum
that one to the london sanctum
together
the sanctums generate a protective shield around our world
the sanctums protect the world
and we sorcerers
protect the sanctums
from what
other dimensional beings that threaten our universe
like dormammu
where did you learn that name
i just read it in the book of cagliostro why
dormammu dwells in the dark dimension
beyond time
he is the cosmic conqueror
the destroyer of worlds
a being of infinite power and endless hunger
on a quest to invade every universe
and bring all worlds into his dark dimension
and he hungers for earth most of all
the pages that kaecilius stole
a ritual to contact dormammu
and draw power from the dark dimension
uh okay
um im out
i came here to heal my hands
not to fight in some mystical war
london
kaecilius
no
wong mordo
hello
hello
daniel i see they made you master of this sanctum
you know what that means
that youll die protecting it
stop
how long have you been at kamartaj mister
doctor
mister doctor
its strange
maybe who am i to judge
ha
you dont know how to use that do you
uh
what
oh stop it
i said stop it
you cannot stop this mister doctor
i dont even know what this is
its the end
and the beginning
the many becoming the few becoming the one
if youre not gonna start making sense
im just gonna to have to put this thing back on
tell me mister doctor
my name is doctor stephen strange
 you are a doctor  yeah
a scientist
you understand the laws of nature
all things age all things die
in the end our sun burns out
our universe grows cold and perishes
but the dark dimension
its a place beyond time
thats it im putting this thing back on
this world doesnt have to die doctor
this world can take its rightful place alongside so many others
as part of the one
the great and beautiful one
we can all live forever
really
what do you have to gain out of this new age dimensional utopia
the same as you
the same as everyone life eternal life
people think in terms of good and evil
when really time is the true enemy of us all
time kills everything
what about the people you killed
tiny
momentary specks within an indifferent universe
yes you see
you see what were doing
the world is not what it ought to be
humanity longs for the eternal
for a world beyond time because time is what enslaves us
time is an insult
death is an insult
doctor
we dont seek to rule this world
we seek to save it
to hand it over to dormammu who is the intent of all evolution
the why of all existence
the sorcerer supreme defends existence
what was it that brought you to kamartaj doctor
was it enlightenment
power
you came to be healed as did we all
kamartaj is a place that collects broken things
we all come with the promise of being healed
and instead the ancient one gives us parlor tricks
the real magic she keeps for herself
you ever wonder how she managed to live this long
i saw the rituals in the book of cagliostro
so you know
the ritual gives me the power
to overthrow the ancient one
and tear her sanctums down
to let the dark dimension in
because what the ancient one hoards
dormammu gives freely
life everlasting
hes not the destroyer of worlds doctor
hes the savior of worlds
no i mean come on
look at your face
dormammu made you a murderer
just how good can his kingdom be
you think thats funny
no not that
whats funny is that youve lost your sling ring
sir can i help you
doctor palmer where is she
 sir we need to get  where is she
the nurses station
christine
stephen
oh my god
get me in an operating theater now just you
now i havent any time
what happened
i was stabbed cardiac tamponade
what are you wearing
chest cavity is clear
no the blood is in the pericardial sac
no no no
stephen
come on come on
just a little higher
please be careful with the needle
stephen
what am i seeing
my astral body
are you dead
no christine but i am dying
right
yeah all right
okay
oh wow
ive never seen a wound like this
what were you stabbed with
i dont know
im gonna have to vanish now
what
keep me alive will you
huh
okay
uhhuh
oh shit
come on come on
stephen come on
hit me again
stop doing that
up the voltage and hit me again
no your hearts beating
just do it
oh my god
oh god oh god
are you okay
yeah
okay
after all this time
you just show up here
flying out of your body
yeah i know
i missed you too by the way
ha ha
i wrote you emails but you never responded
why would i
christine i am so so sorry
for all of it you were right
i was a complete asshole i treated you so horribly
and you deserved so much more
stop youre clearly in shock
what the hell is happening
where have you been
well after western medicine failed me
i headed east and i ended up in kathmandu
kathmandu
yeah
like the bob seger song
1975 beautiful loser side a yeah
i went to a place called kamartaj
and i talked to someone called the ancient one
oh so you joined a cult
no i didnt no not exactly no
they did teach me to tap into powers that i never even knew existed
yeah that sounds like a cult
its not a cult
well thats what a cultist would say
oh no
wait stephen wait what do you think youre doing
im late for a cult meeting
this is insane
yeah
 where are you going  um
can you tell me the truth
well a powerful sorcerer
who gave himself over to an ancient entity
can bend the very laws of physics tried very hard to kill me
but i left him chained up in greenwich village
and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway
that i opened up in the mop closet
okay dont tell me fine
really do have to go
yeah
strange
youre okay
a relative term but yeah im okay
the cloak of levitation
it came to you
no minor feat
its a fickle thing
 hes escaped  kaecilius
yeah
he can fold space and matter at will
he folds matter outside the mirror dimension
in the real world
yeah
 how many more  two
i stranded one in the desert
and the other
his bodys in the hall
master drumm is in the foyer
hes been taken back to kamartaj
the london sanctum has fallen
only new york and hong kong remain now
to shield us from the dark dimension
you defended the new york sanctum from attack
with its master gone it needs another
master strange
no
it is doctor strange
not master strange not mister strange
doctor strange
when i became a doctor i swore an oath to do no harm
and i have just killed a man
im not doing that again
i became a doctor to save lives not take them
you became a doctor to save one life above all others
your own
still seeing through me are you
your overinflated ego
you want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything
even death
which no one can control
not even the great doctor stephen strange
not even dormammu
he offers immortality
its our fear of death that gives dormammu life
he feeds off it
like you feed off him
you talk to me about controlling death
oh i know how you do it
ive seen the missing rituals from the book of cagliostro
measure your next words very carefully doctor
because you might not like them
because you may not know of what you speak
what is he talking about
im talking about her long life the source of her immortality
she draws power from the dark dimension
to stay alive
thats not true
ive seen the rituals worked them out
i know how you do it
once they regroup
the zealots will be back
youll need reinforcements
shes not who you think she is
you dont have the right to say that
youve no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders
no and i dont want to know
youre a coward
because im not a killer
these zealots will snuff us all out
and you cant muster the strength to snuff them first
what do you think i just did
you saved your own life
and then whined about it like a wounded dog
oh you would have done it so easily
youve no idea the things ive done
and the answer is yes
without hesitation
even if theres another way
there is no other way
you lack imagination
no stephen
you lack a spine
theyre back
we have to end this
now
strange
get down here and fight
no
the mirror dimension
you cant affect the real world in here
whos laughing now
asshole
i am
ive got his sling ring
they cant escape right
run
their connection to the dark dimension
makes them more powerful in the mirror dimension
they cant affect the real world but they can still kill us
this wasnt cleverness it was suicide
that is hilarious
this was a mistake
whoa
oh
its true
she does draw power from the dark dimension
kaecilius
i came to you broken
lost in need
trusted you to be my teacher and you fed me lies
i tried to protect you
 from the truth  from yourself
i have a new teacher now
dormammu deceives you
you have no idea what he truly is
his eternal life is not paradise but torment
liar
christine
are you kidding me
oh my god
its not fibrillation she has a stunned myocardium
 neurogenic  yes
someone get the swabs
nic
we need to relieve the pressure on her brain
shes still dropping
were losing her
we need to increase her oxygen
i need a crash cart
her pupils have dilated
no reflexes
were not reading any brain activity
what are you doing
come on youre dying
you have to return to your body now you dont have time
time is relative
your body hasnt even hit the floor yet
ive spent so many years
peering through time
looking at this exact moment
but i cant see past it
ive prevented countless terrible futures
and after each one theres always another
and they all lead here
but never further
you think this is where you die
you wonder what i see in your future
no
yes
i never saw your future
only its possibilities
you have such a capacity for goodness
you always excelled
but not because you craved success
but because of your fear of failure
thats what made me a great doctor
its precisely what kept you from greatness
arrogance and fear still keep you
from learning the simplest
and most significant lesson of all
which is
its not about you
when you first came to me
you asked me how i was able to heal jonathan pangborn
i didnt
he channels dimensional energy directly into his own body
he uses magic to walk
constantly
he had a choice
to return to his own life
or to serve something greater than himself
so i could have my hands back again
my old life
you could
and the world would be all the lesser for it
ive hated drawing power from the dark dimension
but as you well know
sometimes one must break the rules
in order to serve the greater good
mordo wont see it that way
mordos soul is rigid and unmovable
forged by the fires of his youth
he needs your flexibility
just as you need his strength
only together do you stand a chance of stopping dormammu
im not ready
no one ever is
we dont get to choose our time
death is what gives life meaning
to know your days are numbered
your time is short
youd think after all this time id be ready
but look at me
stretching one moment out into a thousand
just so that i can watch the snow
are you okay
i dont understand whats happening
i know
but i have to go away now
you said that losing my hands didnt have to be the end
that it could be a beginning
yeah
because there are other ways to save lives
a harder way
a weirder way
doctor palmer to the er please
doctor palmer to the er
i dont want you to go
stop
choose your weapon wisely
no one steps foot in this sanctum
no one
kaecilius
youre on the wrong side of history wong
shes dead
you were right
she wasnt who i thought she was
she was complicated
complicated
the dark dimension is volatile
dangerous
what if it overtook her
she taught us it was forbidden
while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life
she did what she thought was right
the bill comes due
dont you see
her transgressions led the zealots to dormammu
kaecilius was her fault
and here we are
in the consequence of her deception
a world on fire
mordo the london sanctum has fallen
the new york one has been attacked twice
you know where theyre going next
hong kong
you told me once to fight like my life depended on it
because one day it might
well today is that day
i cannot defeat them alone
the sanctums already fallen
the dark dimension
dormammu is coming
its too late
nothing can stop him
not necessarily
no
the spells working
weve got a second chance
whoa
no
wong
breaking the laws of nature i know
well dont stop now
when the sanctums restored
theyll attack it again
weve got to defend it
come on
get up strange
get up and fight
we can finish this
you cant fight the inevitable
isnt it beautiful
a world beyond time
beyond death
 beyond time  strange
hes gone
even strange has left you and surrendered to his power
dormammu ive come to bargain
youve come to die
your world is now my world
like all worlds
dormammu ive come to bargain
youve come to die
your world is now my
what is this
illusion
no this is real
good
dormammu ive come to bargain
youve what is happening
just as you gave kaecilius powers from your dimension
i brought a little power from mine
this is time
endless looped time
you dare
oh
dormammu ive come to bargain
you cannot do this forever
actually i can
this is how things are now
you and me trapped in this moment
endlessly
then you will spend eternity dying
yes but everyone on earth will live
but you will suffer
pains an old friend
dormammu
ive come to bargain
end this
dormammu dormammu dormammu
you will never win
no
but i can lose
again and again
and again
and again forever
and that makes you my prisoner
no
stop
make this stop
set me free
no
ive come to bargain
what do you want
take your zealots from the earth
end your assault on my world
never come back
do it
and ill break the loop
get up strange
get up and fight
we can finish this
isnt it beautiful
a world beyond time
beyond death
what have you done
i made a bargain
what is this
well its everything youve ever wanted
eternal life as part of the one
youre not gonna like it
yeah you know you really should have
stolen the whole book because the warnings
the warnings come after the spells
oh thats funny
we did it
yes
yes we did it
by also violating
the natural law
look around you its over
you still think there will be no consequences strange
no price to pay
we broke our rules just like her
the bill comes due
always
a reckoning
i will follow this path no longer
yeah okay
wise choice
youll wear the eye of agamotto
once youve mastered its powers
until then
best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone
a what
you might have a gift for the mystic arts
but you still have much to learn
word of the ancient ones death will spread through the multiverse
earth has no sorcerer supreme to defend it
we must be ready
well be ready
thor so earth has wizards now huh
tea
i dont drink tea
what do you drink
not tea
so i keep a watch list
of individuals and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world
your adopted brother loki is one of those beings
worthy inclusion
yeah
so why bring him here to new york
its a bit of a long story
family drama that kind of thing
but were looking for my father
oh okay so if you found odin
youd all return to asgard promptly
oh yes promptly
great
allow me to help you
can i help you
they carried you into kamartaj on a stretcher
look at you now pangborn
mordo
so what can i do for you man
ive been away for many months now
and ive had a revelation
the true purpose of a sorcerer
is to twist things out of their proper shape
stealing power
perverting nature
like you
ive stolen nothing this is my power
 mine  power
has a purpose
why are you doing this
because i see at long last whats wrong with the world
too many sorcerers
long before the birth of light there was darkness
and from that darkness came the dark elves
millennia ago the most ruthless of their kind malekith
sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night
such evil was possible through the power of the aether
an ancient force of infinite destruction
malekith
asgards forces are upon us
the noble armies of asgard led by my father king bor
waged a mighty war against these creatures
send in the cursed
as the nine worlds converged above him
malekith could at last unleash the aether
ahh
but asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp
without it the dark elves fell
with the battle all but lost
malekith sacrificed his own people
in a desperate attempt to lay waste to asgards army
their deaths will mean our survival
this war is far from over
malekith was vanquished and the aether was no more
or so we were led to believe
sire the aether shall we destroy it
if only we could
but its power is too great
bury it deep
somewhere no one will ever find it
loki
hello mother
have i made you proud
please dont make this worse
define worse
enough
i will speak to the prisoner alone
i really dont see what all the fuss is about
do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes
wherever you go there is war ruin
and death
i went down to midgard to rule the people of earth as a benevolent god
just like you
we are not gods we are born we live we die
just as humans do
give or take 5000 years
all this because loki desires a throne
it is my birthright
your birthright was to die
as a child
cast out onto a frozen rock
if i had not taken you in
you would not be here now to hate me
if i am for the axe then for mercys sake
just swing it
its not that i dont love our little talks
its just
i dont love them
frigga is the only reason youre still alive
and you will never see her again
you will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons
and what of thor
youll make that witless oaf king while i rot in chains
thor must strive to undo the damage you have done
he will bring order to the nine realms
and then yes
he will be king
 ah
ive got this completely under control
is that why everything is on fire
ah
youre welcome
ha
all yours
hello
i accept your surrender
anyone else
perhaps next time we should start with the big one
keep moving come on
keep moving go ahead of me dont you turn around
where do we go next
hogan the peace is nearly won across the nine realms
you should stay here be with your people where your heart is
asgard can wait
you have my thanks
as you have mine
heimdall when youre ready
is vanaheim secure
as are nornheim and ria
though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore
you must think im a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily
that was not my intent
for the first time since bifrost was destroyed
the nine realms are at peace
theyre well reminded of our strength
and you have earned their respect and my gratitude
thank you
nothing out of order
except your confused and distracted heart
this isnt about jane foster father
human lives are fleeting theyre nothing
youd be better served by what lies in front of you
im telling you this not as the allfather
but as your father
you are ready
the time has come for you to take the throne
embrace and celebrate what youve won
join your warriors
eat and drink revel in their celebration
at least pretend to enjoy yourself
another
there was a time when you would celebrate for weeks
i remember you celebrated the battle of harokin
so much that you nearly started the second
well the first was so much fun
take a drink with me
surely the allfather could have no further task for you tonight
no this is one i set myself
it does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night
there are nine realms
the future king of asgard must focus on more than one
i thank you for your sword
and for your counsel good lady
hi
hi
so whats the story with you
why does there have to be a story theres no story
you spent the first ten minutes of our date
hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it
its either chicken vegetarian or fish jane
i think theres a story
and im thinking the story involves a guy
its complicated
is he still around
no he
went away
ive been there
the going away its hard isnt it
i was seeing a woman
and she took a job in new york
eventually the distance killed it
and the fact that she kept sleeping with other dudes
 no  oh so many
hi could we get some wine please
sure id love some
richard this is darcy
what are you doing here
oh hello
so i show up to work at the lab your moms house
fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas
eating ice cream and obsessing about
you know who
ah
but youre not youre wearing lady clothes
you even showered didnt you you smell good
is there a point to all this
because there really needs to be a point to all this
right
you know all that scientific equipment you dont look at anymore
you might want to start looking at it again
this is the reason we came all the way out here
its malfunctioning
thats what i said
thats what i did
i thought you would do something a little more scientific
 im sure its nothing  yeah its
it doesnt look like nothing
it kind of looks like the readings that erik was rambling about
our friend erik
kind of went banana balls
hes not interested
 im not interested  im interested
its time for you to go now
okay
short but sweet
she needs help
i think im going to have the sea bass
sea bass yeah sea bass is good
sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass
sea bass
sea bass
jane
maybe you should stop saying sea bass
and go after your friend
this was so fun
ill just stay here and say sea bass alone
and i hate you
what i said he was cute
just shut up and drive
 you need to take the next left
 whos he  hes my intern
 you have an intern  oh yeah
hello dr foster
its such a great honor to be working with you
right i have to call erik
oh take a right
and a left
i have totally mastered driving in london
hi erik its me again where are you
i came here because you said you were onto something and then you vanish
im here at stonehenge
for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today
the police were called to the scene
shortly after 11 am this morning
after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area
then decided to strip naked and effectively
terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment
whilst shouting that he was trying to save them
the man later identified as noted astrophysicist dr erik selvig
has been called in for questioning by police
come on this is exciting
look the intern is excited
ian
do you want the phase meter
 no  bring the phase meter
the toasterlooking thing
yeah i know what the phase meter is
how do i change the ringtone on this thing
an astrophysicist with three degrees
should be able to change her own ringtone
why are you calling me
i didnt want to shout intern says its this way
 ian my name is ian  shh
i am not getting stabbed in the name of science
its okay were americans
is that supposed to make them like us
 theyll make it go away  shh
oh theyre kids
are you the police
no were scientists well i am
thanks
we just found it
can you show us
that doesnt seem right
whered it go
thats
thats incredible
what happened
sometimes they come back
sometimes they dont
i want to throw something
jane give me your shoe
i havent seen readings like this since
since new mexico
dont touch anything
give me your shoe
oh
were those the car keys
whoa ah
oh
darcy
oh
the aether awakens us
the convergence returns
youre late
merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle
then youre doing one of them incorrectly
perhaps
how fare the stars
heimdall still shining
from here i can see nine realms and ten trillion souls
do you recall what i taught you of the convergence
yes
the alignment of the worlds
it approaches doesnt it
the universe hasnt seen this marvel since before my watch began
few can sense it even fewer can see it
but while its effects can be dangerous
it is truly beautiful
i see nothing
or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek
how is she
shes quite clever your mortal
she doesnt know it yet
but she studies the convergence as well
even
what
i cant see her
jane
where the hell were you
tell me you didnt call the police
what was i supposed to do
 not call the police  i was freaking out
you call the cops they call the feds
next thing you know we have shield crawling all over
 area 51ing the place  jane
we had a stable gravitation anomaly
we had unimpeded access
our only competition was ten years old
jane you were gone for five hours
what
thats weird
typical
jane
sorry i just needed to make sure you were real
its been a very strange day
i am jane what
where were you
where were you
heimdall cannot see you
i was right here where you left me
i was waiting and then i was crying
and then i went out looking for you
you said you were coming back
i know i know but the bifrost was destroyed
the nine realms erupted into chaos
wars were raging marauders were pillaging
i had to put an end to the slaughter
as excuses go its not terrible
but i saw you on tv you were in new york
jane i fought to protect you from the dangers of my world
but i was wrong
i was a fool
but i believe that fate brought us together
jane i dont know where you were or what happened but i do know this
what
i know
you do
do what
what
hey
is this you
uh were kind of in the middle of something here
um im pretty sure we are getting arrested
hold that thought
look at you still all muscly and everything
hows space
space is fine
excuse me
 are you jane foster  yes
do you know this man
hes my intern
my interns intern
this is private property and youre trespassing the lot of you
youll have to come with me
jane
 jane  thor
are you all right
what just happened
place your hands on your heads step back
this woman is unwell
shes dangerous
so am i
requesting armed response officers to scene
 hold on to me  what are you doing
holy shit
we have to do that again
hi
welcome to asgard
look upon my legacy algrim
i can barely remember a time before the light
our survival will be your legacy
the asgardians will suffer as we have suffered
i will reclaim the aether
i will restore our world
and i will put an end to this poisoned universe
whats that
be still
this is not of earth what is it
we do not know
but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her
thats a quantum field generator isnt it
its a soul forge
does a soul forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another
yes
quantum field generator
my words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely
she is ill
she is mortal
illness is their defining trait
i brought her here because we can help her
she does not belong here in asgard
any more than a goat belongs at a banquet table
did he just who do you think you are
i am odin king of asgard
protector of the nine realms
oh well im
i know very well who you are jane foster
you told your dad about me
something is within her father
something i have not seen before
her world has its healers
they are called doctors let them deal with it
guards take her back to midgard
no i would not
touch her
jane are you all right
yeah
its impossible
the infection its defending her
no
its defending itself
come with me
there are relics that predate the universe itself
what lies within her appears to be one of them
the nine realms are not eternal
they had a dawn as they will have a dusk
but before that dawn
the dark forces the dark elves reigned absolute and unchallenged
born of eternal night
the dark elves come to steal away the light
i know these stories mother told them to us as children
their leader malekith made a weapon out of that darkness
and it was called the aether
while the other relics often appear as stones
the aether is fluid and ever changing
it changes matter into dark matter
it seeks out host bodies drawing strength from their lifeforce
malekith sought to use the aethers power
to return the universe to one of darkness
but after eternities of bloodshed
my father bor finally triumphed
ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years
what happened
he killed them all
are you certain
the aether was said to have been destroyed with them
and yet here it is
the dark elves are dead
does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me
no
it does not
the worlds are nearly aligned
you will be the last of the kursed
let my life be sacrificed
it is no less than our people did
or you have done
you will become darkness
cursed to this existence until it consumes you
until then no power our enemies possess can stop you
i will tear down their defenses and ensure your return to a universe reborn
acting as caretakers to these scoundrels is beneath us
oh please if they were beneath you
my rotund friend theyd all be dead
 keep in line  move it
odin continues to bring me new friends
how thoughtful
the books i sent do they not interest you
is that how i am to while away eternity reading
ive done everything in my power to make you comfortable loki
have you
does odin share your concern
does thor
it must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night
you know full well it was your actions that brought you here
my actions
i was merely giving truth to the lie that i had been fed my entire life
that i was born to be a king
a king
a true king admits his faults
what of the lives you took on earth
a mere handful compared to the number
that odin has taken himself
 your father  hes not my father
then am i not your mother
youre not
youre always so perceptive about everyone but yourself
when you came for me you knew i was in trouble
heimdall had lost sight of you
you were no longer on earth
how is that possible
i believe you were and you werent
the nine realms travel within yggdrasil
orbiting midgard much the way your planets orbit the sun
and every 5000 years the worlds align perfectly
and we call this the convergence
during this time the borders between worlds become blurred
its possible you found one of these points
we are lucky that it remained open
once the worlds pass out of alignment
then the connection is lost
i like the way you explain things
whats going to happen to me
ill find a way to save you jane
 your father said there was  my father doesnt know everything
dont let him hear you say that
jane foster please meet frigga
queen of asgard and my mother
hi
move
to the dungeons
come on
you might want to take the stairs to the left
the prisons
 loki  go
i will look after her
its as if they resent being imprisoned
 theres no pleasing some creatures
return to your cells no further harm will come to you
you have my word
very well you do not have my word
send a squadron to the weapons vault
defend it at all costs secure the dungeon
 odin  frigga
go
its a skirmish
nothing to fear
youve never been a very good liar
take her to your chambers
ill come for you when its safe
you take care
despite all i have survived
my queen still worries over me
its only because i worry over you
that you have survived
listen to me now
i need you to do everything i ask no questions
yes maam
oh
 ow  ah
the throne of asgard is destroyed to the king
frigga
stand down creature
and you may still survive this
i have survived worse woman
who are you
i am malekith
and i would have what is mine
ah
you have taken something child
give it back
witch
where is the aether
ill never tell you
i believe you
no
the universe rotates on a 5000 year cycle
and once a cycle all the worlds align
imagine imagine that this is our world
oh thank you and this is another world
normally theyre separate
but during the alignment
everything is connected all nine realms
all nine realms are passing through each other
and gravity light and even matter
is crashing from one world to the other
but if this happens to us now the result will be cataclysmic
my gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the convergence
this time the alignment
and all the other worlds would just pass us by
its beautiful
its simple any questions
yeah
can i have my shoe back
heal you will need your strength to reclaim the aether
and when you wake we will kill them all
jane foster
you need to come with us
we are still unable to restore the palace shields
our artillery cannot detect them
even heimdall cannot see them
my king we are all but defenseless
shes your prisoner now
leave us
i do not wish to fight with you
nor i with you
but i intend to pursue malekith
we possess the aether
malekith will come to us
yes and he will destroy us
you overestimate the power of these creatures
no i value our peoples lives
ill take jane to the dark world and draw the enemy away from asgard
when malekith pulls the aether from jane
it will be exposed and vulnerable
and i will destroy it and him
if you fail you risk this weapon
falling into the hands of our enemies
the risk is far greater if we do nothing
his ship could be over our heads right now
we would never even know it
if and when he comes
his men will fall on 10000 asgardian blades
and how many of our men shall fall on theirs
as many as are needed
ah
we will fight
till the last asgardian breath
till the last drop of asgardian blood
then how are you different from malekith
the difference my son is that i will win
jane isnt calling me back erik isnt calling me back
stupid shield isnt calling me back
 whats shield  its a secret
hey erik its darcy again
thor came back he took jane to asgard
and im not sure what im supposed to do
something else went missing this week
when astrophysicist dr erik selvig
notable for his involvement in the alien invasion of new york
streaked nude across
darcy you really need to look at this
your friend erik
what was his last name again
and began shouting at visitors to the historic site
he was later taken into police custody
for psychiatric evaluation
police are still refusing to confirm
you were not at odins war council
the bifrost is closed by your fathers orders
no one is to come or to go
we face an enemy that is invisible even to me
what use is a guardian such as that
malekith will return you know this
i need your help
i cannot overrule my kings wishes not even for you
im not asking you to
the realms need their allfather strong and unchallenged
whether he is or not
but he is blinded heimdall
by hatred and by grief
as are we all
i see clearly enough
the risks are too great
everything we do from here on is a risk
there is no other way
what do you require of me
what im about to ask of you is treason of the highest order
success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death
malekith knew the aether was here he can sense its power
if we do nothing he will come for it again
but this time lay waste to all of asgard
we must move jane offworld
the bifrost has been shut down
and the tesseract locked away in the vault
there are other paths off asgard ways known only to a few
one actually
no
thor after all this time
and now you come to visit me
why
have you come to gloat to mock
loki enough
no more illusions
now you see me brother
did she suffer
i did not come here to share our grief
instead i offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament
go on
i know you seek vengeance as much as i do
you help me escape asgard and i will grant it to you
vengeance and afterward this cell
you must be truly desperate to come to me for help
what makes you think you can trust me
i dont
mother did
but you should know that when we fought each other in the past
i did so with a glimmer of hope
that my brother was still in there somewhere
that hope no longer exists to protect you
you betray me and i will kill you
hmm
when do we start
he will betray you
he will try
this is so unlike you brother
so clandestine
are you sure you wouldnt rather just punch your way out
if you keep speaking i just might
fine as you wish
im not even here
is this better
its better company at least
still we could be less conspicuous
mmm brother you look ravishing
it will hurt no less when i kill you in this form
very well perhaps you prefer one of your new companions
given that you seem to like them so much
oh this is much better
ooh
the costume is a bit much so tight
but the confidence
i can feel the righteousness surging
hey do you want to have a rousing discussion about truth
honor patriotism
god bless amer
what
you could at least furnish me with a weapon
my dagger something
at last
a little common sense
and i thought you liked tricks
well what then your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of einherjar
who will see you coming from miles away
i wont be the one who comes for her
im not hungry
what the good lets go
youre
im loki you may have heard of me
that was for new york
i like her
and what of the allfather
it is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne
you called me here on an urgent matter
what is it
treason my lord
whose
mine
my king
the mortal has been taken
stop thor
by any means necessary
there they are take them
on my command
ill hold them off take her
thank you
betray him and ill kill you
its good to see you too sif
assuming you can get lokis help and you can free this mortal
what good would it do
wed all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace
that my friend is why we wont be leaving by foot
i will give you as much time as i can
thank you my friend
if you even think about betraying him
youll kill me
evidently there will be a line
i thought you said you knew how to fly this thing
i said how hard could it be
theyre on the ship
get to the ship
well whatever youre doing brother i suggest you do it faster
 shut up loki
you must have missed something
no i didnt im pressing every button on this thing
no dont hit it just press it gently
im pressing it gently its networking
ha ha
get him get him
 i think you missed a column  shut up
look why dont you let me take over
im clearly the better pilot
is that right well out of the two of us
which one can actually fly
oh dear is she dead
jane
im okay
ah
not a word
now theyre following us
now theyre firing at us
yeah thank you for the commentary loki
its not at all distracting
well done you just decapitated your grandfather
you know this is wonderful
this is a tremendous idea
lets steal the biggest most obvious ship in the universe
and escape in that
flying around the city
smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us
its brilliant thor its truly brilliant
i see your time in the dungeons
has made you no less graceful loki
you lied to me
im impressed
im glad youre pleased
now do as you promised
and take us to your secret pathway
 fandral  right
for asgard
nothing personal boys
loki
if it were easy everyone would do it
 are you mad  possibly
lon yaden
we must strike now
no
asgard is meaningless
the aether has found its way home
what i could do with the power that flows through those veins
it would consume you
shes holding up all right
for now
shes strong in ways youd never even know
say goodbye
not this day
this day the next a hundred years its nothing
its a heartbeat
youll never be ready
the only woman whose love youve prized
will be snatched from you
and will that satisfy you
satisfaction is not in my nature
surrender is not in mine
 the son of odin  no
not just of odin
you think you alone were loved of mother
you had her tricks but i had her trust
trust
was that her last expression
trust when you let her die
 what help were you in your cell  who put me there
who put me there
you know damn well
 you know damn well who
she wouldnt want us to fight
well she wouldnt exactly be shocked
i wish i could trust you
trust my rage
youll have to sign for your fathers belongings mr selvig
what
oh yeah
my father dr erik selvig
one mans leather wallet brown
one key ring three keys
prescription medicine
various
 and  erik

thank goodness
erik

i dont get paid enough i dont get paid period
im ian by the way uh darcys intern
yeah i dont get paid either
are you all right
ive had a god in my brain
 i dont recommend it
dr selvig sir your gear is beeping at me
its happening its sooner than i calculated
wait whats happening
birds
birds are happening
theyre starlings its called a murmuration
my dad he used to take me bird watching as a kid
 nerd  look
where did they go
what the hell was that
why are you smiling
theres nothing more reassuring
than realizing that the world is crazier than you are
take me to janes lab
jane
malekith
all right are you ready
i am
you know this plan of yours is going to get us killed
yes possibly
you still dont trust me brother
would you
no i wouldnt
thor
no
you really think i cared about frigga
about any of you
all i ever wanted
was you and odin dead at my feet
malekith
i am loki of jotunheim
 and i bring you a gift
i ask only one thing in return
a good seat from which
 to watch asgard burn
he is an enemy of asgard
he was a prisoner in their dungeons
look at me
loki now
ah
ah
 ah  no
see you in hell monster
no no no no
oh you fool you didnt listen
i know
im a fool im a fool
stay with me okay
im sorry
 im sorry im sorry  shh
its okay
its all right
ill tell father what you did here today
i didnt do it for him
no
hes going to unleash it
not just on asgard or on a star malekith is going to destroy everything
how
jane how
i saw him on earth why would he go to earth
the convergence
oh god
none of this would have happened if i hadnt found the aether
then malekith wouldve only possessed it
that much sooner
i only found it because i was looking for you
jane
now were trapped here
its not me
hello
hi jane its richard
richard where are you
im still at the office
its been a crazy day here today
 oh my god this is amazing  is it
i quite enjoyed our lunch
despite never actually ordering anything
how am i getting service here
is this a bad time do you want me to try you later
no no no please whatever you do do not hang up the phone
okay then
i was just wondering if you want to try again
uh maybe dinner next time
uh yeah yeah yeah
 just stay on the phone okay  yeah i will
on my god
am i interrupting something
no no no nothing at all
come on
im losing you there are you in a tunnel
where are we going
hello
why are there so many shoes in here
ill just text her
so whos richard
really
 jane  hey
you cant just leave like that
the whole world is going crazy
all the stuff we saw is spreading
 did you go to a party  erik
jane how wonderful
oh
 youve been to asgard  where are your pants
oh he uh he says it helps him think
okay well im going to need everything you got on this
all the work youve been doing on gravimetric anomalies everything
okay
 are you well erik
your brothers not coming is he
loki is dead
oh thank god
i i meant im so sorry
thank you
forgive me my liege
ive returned from the dark world with news
thor
there was no sign of thor or the weapon but
what
we found a body
loki
malekith is going to fire the aether at a spot
where all the nine worlds are connecting
amplifying the weapons impact
for each additional world
the power will increase exponentially
the effect would be universal
but the alignment is only temporary
he must be in exactly the right place at the right time
well how do we know where that is
we follow the directions
this has happened before
thousands of years ago and the ancients were there to see it
all the great constructions
the mayans the chinese the egyptians
they made use of the gravitational effects of the convergence
and they left us a map
stonehenge
snowdon the great orme
these are all coordinates taking us
here
greenwich
the walls between worlds will be almost nonexistent
physics is going to go ballistic
increases and decreases in gravity
spatial extrusions
the very fabric of reality is going to be torn apart
i better get my pants
focus this is important
we have to hammer them in all around the site
and then jane and erik will activate them from the tower
theyre taped together
do you even know what these things do
uh no
neither do i
shh
 come on come on come on  right
holy shit
ah
you neednt have come so far asgardian
death wouldve come to you soon enough
not by your hand
your universe was never meant to be
your world and your family
will be extinguished
were running out of time
 almost there  are you sure this is going to work
these devices were made to detect anomalies not cause them
oh come on
come on darcy
you know with all that power
i thought youd hit harder
done
the convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes
that just means we have to keep malekith busy for eight
okay you might want to hold on to something
that is awesome
how did you do that
well the gravitational fields
interact with the weak spots between worlds creating
ooh get the guy with the sword
 oops  lets go
um
 what the hell just happened
move
what are you all doing
you need to get out of here now
youre joking right
thats thor out there
hes waving his hammer around and everything
ah
confirming ship is hostile
confirmed ship is hostile
you have permission to engage
roger
missiles locked
missiles away
missiles off target
i repeat target missed im losing control
mayday mayday lost positive control
what are you doing
my signals not connecting
jane
come on
are you all right
you saved my life
yeah
i guess i did
mmm
darcy
 jane
 ian  selvig
mew mew
mind the gap
how do i get to greenwich
take this train three stops
mind the gap
sorry sorry
 were out of time  jane
jane
thor
were too late
the convergence is at its peak
can those things stop him
not from here
we cant get close enough
i can
malekith
darkness returns asgardian
have you come to witness the end of your universe
ive come to accept your surrender
you think you can stop this
the aether cannot be destroyed
but you can
thor no
jane
ah
everybody okay
hes gonna come back
except you know
last time he was gone for like two years
well its only been two days so
did he say anything before he left
yeah he had to figure some stuff out with his father
he kinda committed treason on our way out
oh
you once said there would never be a wiser king than me
you were wrong
the alignment has brought all the realms together
every one of them saw you offer your life to save them
what can asgard offer its new king in return
my life
father i cannot be king of asgard
i will protect asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath
but i cannot do so from that chair
loki for all his grave imbalance understood rule as i know i never will
the brutality the sacrifice
it changes you
id rather be a good man than a great king
is this my son i hear or the woman he loves
when you speak do i never hear mothers voice
this is not for jane father
she does not know what i came here to say
now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side
it changes nothing
one son who wanted the throne too much
another who will not take it
is this my legacy
loki died with honor
i shall try to live the same
is that not legacy enough
it belongs to you
if you are worthy of it
i shall try to be
i cannot give you my blessing nor can i wish you good fortune
i know
if i were proud of the man my son had become
even that i could not say
it would speak only from my heart
go
my son
thank you father
no
thank you
i present to you
taneleer tivan the collector
whoa
asgardians its an honor
you know why were here
of course
but if i may ask
why not keep it secure in your own vault
the tesseract is already on asgard
it is not wise to keep two infinity stones so close together
thats very wise
i can assure you
it will be absolutely safe here
in my collection
see that it is
one down
five to go
dreamworks animation skg dreamworks animation presents kung fu panda legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend
he travelled the land
in search of worthy foes
i see you like to chew
maybe you should chew on my fist
the warrior said nothing
for his mouth was full
then he swallowed
and then he spoke
enough talk lets fight
he was so deadly in fact
that his enemies will go blind
from over exposure to pure
awesomeness
my eyes
hes too awesome
and attractive
how can we repay you
there is no charge for awesomeness
or attractiveness
it mattered not how many foes he faced
they were no match for his voracity
never before had a panda
been so feared and so loved
even the most heroic heroes
in all of china
the furious five
bowed in respect to this great master
we should hang out
agreed
but hanging out would
have to wait
cause when youre facing the ten
thousand demons of demon mountain
there is only one thing
that matters and thats

page 1032
the secret to limitless power
no i
one must first master the highest
level of kung fu
and that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you
someone like me
yes
look at you
this fat blob flabby arms
those are sensitive
in the flabby parts
and this ridiculous belly
heywhooo
and utter disregard for personal hygiene now wait a minute
thats a little uncalled for
dont stand that close i can smell your breath listen oogway said that i was the uh the wushi finger hold
never master shifu dont
haaoh you know this hold
developed by master wushi in the
oh then you must know what happens
when i flex my pinky
no no no
you know the hardest part of this the hardest part is cleaning up afterwards humm
okay okay take it easy
now listen closely panda
oogway may have picked you
but when im through with you
i promise you
youre going to wish he hadnt
are we clear
yes were clear were clear
we are so clear
good hmm hmm hmm
i cant wait to get started
lets begin
wait wait wait
now
yes now
page 1132
unless you think that the great oogway was wrong and you are not the dragon warrior okay well i dont know
if i can do all of those moves
well if we dont try
we will never know will we
yes its just maybe we can find
something more suited to my level
and what level is that
well you know
im not a master but
lets just start at zero
level zero
there is no such thing as level zero hey maybe i can start with that
that we use that
for training children
and popping the door
open when it is hot
but if you insist
wow the furious five
youre so much bigger
than your action figures
except for you mantis
youre about the same
go ahead panda
show us what you can do
ahhare they going to watch or should i just wait until they get back to work or something hit it
okay i mean i just ate
and so im still digesting so my
kung fu may not be as good as later on just hit it
whatd you got
youve got nothing cos i got it right here you picking on my friends
get ready to fell the thunder
come on crazy feet
whatre you going to do about crazy feet come on im a blur im a blur
youve never seen bear style
youve only seen praying mantis
or monkey style
page 1232
imagine snakekiddy snake
would you hit it
alright alright
why dont you try it again
a little harder
hows that
oohhh
oh that hurts
this will be easier than i thought
feeling a little nausea
ouch ouch ouch
oohh my tenders
how did i do
there is now a level zero
dont deny that
i dont understand what master oogway was thinking poor guy is going to get himself killed he is so fighty
the dragon warrior fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire
when he walks
the very ground shakes
one would think that master oogway would choose someone who actually knew kung fu yes or could at least touch his toes
or even see his toes
okay
great
ooouuch
oh hey hi
youre up
am now
i was justersomedayeh
the kung fu stuff is hard work right
your biceps sore
ive had a long day and rather
disappointing day soer
yai should probably get to sleep now ya yaof course
okay thanks
its just im such a big fan
you guys were so totally amazing
at the battle of the weeping river
outnumbered a thousand to one
page 1332
but you didnt stop you just oh sorry about that
ahh look you dont belong here eri know i know
youre right
i dont have it
its just my whole life i dream of no no no i meant you dont
belong here i mean in this room but this is my room
property of crane
oh okay right right

ya you want to get to sleep
keeping you up
weve got big things tomorrow
alright you are awesome the last thing im going to say okay byebye

i didnt say anything
okay alright goodnight
sleep well
seem a little bit awkward
master tigress didnt mean
to wake you just a
you dont belong here
ah yaya of course
this is your room
i mean you dont belong in the jade palace youre a disgrace to kung fu and if you have any respect of who we are and what we do
you will be gone by morning
big fan
i see youve found the sacred peach tree of heavenly wisdom
is that what this is
im so sorry
i thought it was just
a regular peach tree
i understand you eat
when you are upset
upset im not upset
why would i be upset
page 1432
so why are you upset
i probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu in the history of china
in the history of sucking
probably
and the fiveman
you should have seen them
they totally hate me
totally
hows shifu ever going to turn me into the dragon warrior
i mean im not like the five
ive got no claws
no wings
no venom
even mantis got those thingies may be i should just quit
and go back to making noodles quit dont quit
noodles dont noodles
you are too concerned with
what was and what will be
theres a saying
yesterday is history
tomorrow is a mystery
but today is a gift
that is why it is called the present oh no
whats happening
to your battle stations
go go go
fire crossbow
fire
fire
tai lungs free i must warn shifu you are not going anywhere
neither is he
let go of me
bring it up
wait bring it back
hes going this way
he wont get far
archers
page 1532
we dead
so very very dead
haha not yet were not
now
can we run now
yes
i am glad shifu sent you
i was beginning to feel
im being forgotten
fly back there and tell them the real dragon warrior is coming home good morning master
panda
panda wake up
hmm hmm hmm
hes quitted
what do we do now master
with the panda gone
who will be the dragon warrior all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time
the true dragon warrior will be revealed what are you doing here
haahey
good morning master
i thought ill warm up a little youre stuck
stucknowhatstuck
nothis is one of the
yaim stuck
help him
oh dear
lift me on three
one two 
thank you
dont mention it
no really i appreciate it
ever
you actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one night it takes years to develop
ones flexibility
and years longer to apply it in combat put that down
page 1632

the only souvenirs we collect down here are bloody knuckles and broken bones yaahahaha
excellent
lets get started
are you ready
i was born readyoww
owwoh im sorry brother
i thought you said youre ready
that was awesome
lets go again
ive been taking it easy on you panda but no more your next opponent will be me
alright yalets go
step forth
the true path to victory is to find your opponents weakness
and make him suffer for it
oh yeah to take his strength
and use it against him
until he finally falls or quits
but a real warrior never quits
dont worry master ill never quit if he is smart he wont
come back those steps
but he will
hes not going to quit is he
hes not going to quit bouncing
ill tell you that
oouch i thought you said
accupuncture will make me feel better trust me it will
its just not easy finding right nerve points under all thisfat
fur
i was going to say fur
sure you were
who am i to judge a warrior
based on his size
so i mean look at me
im over here
haaaah
maybe you should take a look at this again page 1732

ohh okay
oouch
stop stop it
eeeouch
i know master shifu is trying
to inspire me and all
but if i didnt know any better
ill say hes trying to get rid of me i know he can seem like heartless aaahh
but you know he wasnt
always like that
according to legend there was once a time when master shifu actually used to spy no
yes but that was before
before what
before tai lung
aahya
we are not really suppose to talk about him well if he is going to stay here
he should now
guys guys
i know about tai lung
he was a student the first to ever master the 1000 scrolls of kung fu and then he turned bad
and now hes in jail
he wasnt just a student
shifu found him as a cub
and he raised him as his son
and when the child showed
talent in kung fu
shifu trained him
he believed in him he told him
he was destined for greatness
it was never enough for tai lung
he wanted the dragon scroll
but oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused
outraged tai lung
laid waste to the valley
he tried to take the scroll by force and shifu has to destroy
page 1832
what he had created
but how could he
shifu loved tai lung like he
has never love anyone before
whats it
and now he has a chance
to make things right
to train the true dragon warrior and he is stuck with you
a big fat panda who
treats it like a joke
ohh thats it
wait my fault
i accidentally tweaked his facial nerves and may have also stopped his heart inner peace
inner peace
innerininin
inner peace
look whoever is making that
flapping sound quiet down
innerquaaa
oh zeng excellent
i could use some good news now aaahh
master master
hmm
iihave its a
its a very bad news
aah shifu theres just news no good or bad
master your vision was right
tai lung has broken out of prison hes on his way
that is bad news
 if you do not believe that
the dragon warrior can stop him panda master that panda
is not the dragon warrior
he wasnt even meant to be here it was an accident
there are no accidents
yes i know
you said that already
page 1932

twice
well that was no accident either thrice
my old friend
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny nor you yours
until you let go of the
illusion of control
illusion
yes
look at this tree shifu
i cannot make it blossom
when it suits me
nor make it bear
fruit before its time
but there are things
we can control
i can control when
the fruit will fall
i can control where
to plant the seed
that is no illusion master
ahyes but no matter
what you do
that seed will grow
to be a peach tree
you may wish for an
apple or an orange
but you will get a peach
but a peach cannot defeat tai lung maybe it can if you are willing to guide it to nurture it
to believe in it
but how how
i need your help master
no you just need to believe
promise me shifu
promise me you will believe
i i will try
hmmgood
my time has come
you must continue your journey without me
whatwhatwhat are you page 2032
wait
master
you cant leave me
you must believe
master
im not scaredyet
sound like fun he maybe a wolf you may be the scariest bandit
in harjin province
but youre a lousy tipper
really
so how did you
get out of there alive
i mean i didnt actually said that but i thought it in my mind
if he could read my mind
he would have been likewhat order up
you like it
this is really good
now come on you should try
my dads secret ingredient soup he actually knows the secret ingredient what are you talking about
this is amazing
wowyou are really a good cook i wish my mouth was bigger
tigress you got to try this
hmm
it is said that the dragon warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe i guess my body doesnt know
its the dragon warrior yet
i need lard more than dew
and the universe juice
what
oh nothing master shifu
hahahaha
you will never be the dragon warrior unless you lose 500 pounds
and brush your teeth
what is the noise youre making page 2132
laughter
i have never heard of it
work hard panda and maybe someday youll have ears like mine
thats good
ohoh yup
ears
its not working for you
i thought theyre pretty good its shifu
of course its shifu
what do you think im doing
master shifu
aahh
you think this is funny
tai lung has escaped from prison and you all are acting like children what
hes coming for the dragon scroll and youre the only one who can stop him haand here i am saying youve got no a sense of humour
i am gonna step down
what youre serious
and i have toaaanot
master oogway will stop him
he did it before hell do it again oogway cannot
not anymore
haa
our only hope is the dragon warrior the panda
yes the panda
master please let us stop tai lung this is what you train us for no it is not your destiny to defeat tai lung it is his
where did he go
you cannot leave
a real warrior never quit
watch me
come on how am i suppose
to beat tai lung
i cant even beat you to the stairs page 2232

you will beat him because
you are the dragon warrior
ouch
you dont believe that
oh you never believed that
from the first moment i got here youve been trying to get rid of me yes i was
but now i ask you to trust in your master as i have come to trust in mine you are not my master
and i am not the dragon warrior then why didnt you quit
you knew i was trying to get rid of you yet you stayed
ya i stayed
i stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head
or said i smelled it hurt
but it could never hurt more than it did everyday in my life just being me i stayed because i thought if anyone could change me could make me not me it was you the greatest
kung fu teacher of all of china but i can change you i can turn you into the dragon warrior and i will come on tai lung is
on his way right now
and even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here
how are you going to change
this into the dragon warrior
hah
how
how
how
i dont know
i do not know
thats what i thought
this is what she trains for it
tigress
dont try and stop me
we are not trying to stop you
page 2332
what
we are coming with you
what
i eat when i am upset okay
oh no need to explain
i just thought you might be monkey he hides his almond cookies in the topshelf dont tell monkey
look at you
yaaa
i know i disgust you
no i mean how did you get up there i dont knowi
i dont know just get the cookies and yet you are 10 feet off the ground and have done a perfect split

i know you are trying to be
all mystical and kung fuee
but could you least tell me
where we are going
you drag me all the way
out here for a bath
panda we do not wash our pits
in the pool of sacred tears
uuhthe pool of
this is where oogway unraveled
the mysteries of harmony and focus this is the birth place of kung fu do you want to learn kung fu
yes
then i am your master
okay
dont cry
okay
when you focus on kung fu
when you concentrate you stink
but perhaps that is my fault
i cannot train you the way i trained the five i see now that the way to get
through to you is with this
aah great cause i am hungry
good when you have been trained
page 2432
you may eat
lets begin
after you panda

his nerve attack
he has gotten stronger
tai lung

of special sauce or something

yes you have a new favourite
so where is this po
did i scare him off
this battle is between you and me so thats how its going to be
that is how it must be
i rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness
obeying your master is not weakness you knew i was the dragon warrior you always knew
but when oogway said otherwise
what did you do
what did you do
nothing
you were not meant to be the dragon warrior that was not my fault
not your fault
who failed my every dream
who told we should train
until my bones cracked
who denied me my destiny
it was never my decision to make
it is now
give me the scroll
i would rather die
what i ever did
i did to make you proud
tell me how proud you are shifu

ii have always
been proud of you
from the first moment

this is the asgardian
refugee vessel statesman
we are under assault
i repeat we are under assault
the engines are dead life support failing
requesting aid from any vessel within range
we are 22 jump points out of asgard
our crew is made up of asgardian families
we have very few soldiers here
this is not a warcraft
i repeat this is not a warcraft
hear me and rejoice
you have had the privilege
of being saved by the great titan
you may think this is suffering
no
it is salvation
universal scales tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice
smile
for even in death
you have become children of thanos
i know what its like to lose
to feel so desperately that youre right
yet to fail nonetheless
its frightening
turns the legs to jelly
but i ask you to what end
dread it run from it
destiny arrives all the same
and now its here
or should i say
i am
you talk too much
the tesseract
or your brothers head
i assume you have a preference
oh i do
kill away
all right stop
we dont have the tesseract
it was destroyed on asgard
you really are the worst brother
i assure you brother
the sun will shine on us again
your optimism is misplaced asgardian
well for one thing im not asgardian
and for another
we have a hulk
 let him have his fun
allfathers
let the dark magic flow through me one last
time
that was a mistake
no
youre going to die for that
shh
my humble personage
bows before your grandeur
no other being has ever had the might
nay the nobility
to wield not one but two infinity stones
the universe lies within your grasp
there are two more stones on earth
find them my children and bring them to me on titan
father we will not fail you
if i might interject
if youre going to earth you might want a guide
i do have a bit of experience in that arena
if you consider failure experience
i consider experience experience
almighty thanos
i loki prince of asgard
odinson
the rightful king of jotunheim
god of mischief
do hereby pledge to you
my undying fidelity
undying
you should choose your words more carefully
you
will never be
a god
no
no resurrections this time
no loki
seriously you dont have any money
attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual
ill tell the guys at the deli
maybe theyll make you a metaphysical ham on rye
oh wait wait wait i think i have 200
dollars
 rupees  which is
 uh buck and a half
what do you want
i wouldnt say no to a tuna melt
thanos is coming
hes coming
who
slow down slow down ill spell it out for you
youre totally rambling
  no im not   you lost me
look you know how youre having a dream
and in the dream you gotta pee
 yeah  okay
and then youre like oh my god
theres no bathrooms what am i gonna do
oh someones watching right
oh im gonna go in my pants
and then you wake up and in real life
you actually have to pee
 yes  yeah
 okay  everybody has that
right thats the point im trying to make
apropos of that last night i dreamt we had a kid
it was so real
we named him after your eccentric uncle
uh what was his name
 right  morgan morgan
 so you woke up  naturally
and thought that we were
 expecting  yeah
 yes  no
i had a dream about it it was so real
if you wanted to have a kid
you wouldnt have done that
im glad you brought this up cause its nothing
its just a housing unit for nanoparticles
youre not helping your case okay
no this is detachable its not a
you dont need that
i know i had the surgery
im just trying to protect us
and future usses and thats it
just in case theres a monster in the closet
 instead of you know  shirts
you know me so well
 god  you finish all my sentences
you should have shirts in your closet
yeah
you know what there should be no more surprises
were gonna have a nice dinner tonight
 show off this harry winston
right and we should have no more surprises ever
i should promise you
 yes  i will
thank you
tony stark
im doctor stephen strange i need you to come with me
oh uh congratulations on the wedding by the way
im sorry you giving out tickets to something
we need your help
its not overselling it to say that
the fate of the universe is at stake
and whos we
hey tony
bruce
 pepper  hi
 oh  you okay
at the dawn of the universe
there was nothing then
boom
the big bang sent six elemental crystals
hurtling across the virgin universe
these infinity stones
each control an essential aspect of existence
space
reality
power
soul
mind
and time
tell me his name again
thanos
hes a plague tony
he invades planets he takes what he wants
he wipes out half the population
he sent loki
the attack on new york thats him
this is it
whats our timeline
no telling he has the power and space stones
that already makes him
the strongest creature in the whole universe
if he gets his hands on all six stones tony
he could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of
did you seriously just say hitherto undreamt of
are you seriously leaning on the cauldron of the cosmos
 is that what it is
im going to allow that
if thanos needs all six why dont we just
stick this one down a garbage disposal
no can do
we swore an oath to protect the time stone with our lives
and i swore off dairy
but then ben  jerrys named a flavor after me
 stark raving hazelnuts  not bad
a bit chalky
a hunk of hulk of burning fudge is our favorite
 thats a thing  whatever
point is things change
our oath to protect the time stone cannot change
and this stone may be the best chance we have against thanos
yeah so conversely
it may also be his best chance against us
well if we dont do our jobs
what is your job exactly
besides making balloon animals
protecting your reality douchebag
okay guys could we table this discussion right now
the fact is we have this stone
we know where it is
vision is out there somewhere with the mind stone
and we have to find him now
yeah thats the thing
what do you mean
two weeks ago vision turned off his transponder
hes offline
 what  yeah
tony you lost another superbot
i didnt lose him hes more than that hes evolving
who could find vision then
shit
probably steve rogers
oh great
maybe
but
call him
its not that easy
god we havent caught up in a spell have we

 which isnt the point  which isnt the point
i mean if he doesnt pony up
we take his ship
 exactly  bingo
all right
we are arriving
all right guardians
dont forget this might be dangerous
so lets put on our mean faces
groot put that thing away now
i dont wanna tell you again
 groot
i am groot
 whoa  language
 hey  wow
you got some acorns on you kid
ever since you got a little sap
youre a total dhole
now keep it up and im gonna smash that thing to pieces
what happened
oh my god
looks like were not getting paid
wipers wipers
get it off
how the hell is this dude still alive
he is not a dude
youre a dude
this this is a man
a handsome muscular man
im muscular
but who are you kidding quill
youre one sandwich away from fat
yeah right
its true quill you have put on weight
what
gamora do you think im
he is anxious angry
he feels tremendous loss and guilt
its like a pirate had a baby with an angel
wow
this is a real wakeup call for me okay
im gonna get a bowflex im gonna commit
im gonna get some dumbbells
you know you cant eat dumbbells right
its like his muscles
are made of cotati metal fibers
stop massaging his muscles
wake him up
wake
who the hell are you guys
the entire time i knew thanos he only ever had one goal
to bring balance to the universe
by wiping out half of all life
he used to kill people planet by planet
massacre by massacre
including my own
if he gets all six infinity stones
he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this
you seem to know a great deal about thanos
gamora is the daughter of thanos
your father killed my brother
oh boy
stepfather technically
and she hates him as much as you do
families can be tough
before my father died
he told me that i had a halfsister
that he imprisoned in hel
and then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye
so i had to kill her
thats life though isnt it i guess
goes round and round and
i feel your pain
i feel your pain as well because
i mean its not a competition
but ive been through a lot
 my father killed my mother
and then i had to kill my father
 that was hard
probably even harder than having to kill a sister
plus i came out with both my eyes which was
i need a hammer not a spoon
how do i open this thing is there some sort of uh
a fourdigit code maybe maybe a birthdate
 uh what are you doing  taking your pod
no youre not
you will not be taking our pod today sir
uh quill are you making your voice deeper
 no  you are
youre imitating the godman its weird
no im not
he just did it again  this is my voice
are you mocking me
 are you mocking me  stop it you did it again
hes trying to copy me
i need you to stop doing that
enough  hes doing it first
we need to stop thanos
which means we need to find out
where hes going next
knowhere
he must be going somewhere
no no knowhere
its a place weve been there it sucks
 excuse me thats our food  not anymore
thor why would he go to knowhere
because for years
the reality stones been safely stored there
with a man called the collector
if its with the collector then its not safe
only an idiot would give that man a stone
 or a genius  how do you know
hes not going for one of the other stones
there are six stones out there
thanos already has the power stone
because he stole it last week when he decimated xandar
he stole the space stone from me
when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people
the time and mind stones are safe on earth
theyre with the avengers
 the avengers  earths mightiest heroes
like kevin bacon
he may be on the team i dont know
i havent been there in a while
as for the soul stone well no ones ever seen that
no one even knows where it is
therefore thanos cant get it
therefore hes going to knowhere
hence hell be getting the reality stone
youre welcome
then we have to go to knowhere now
wrong where we have to go is nidavellir
 thats a madeup word  all words are made up
nidavellir is real seriously
that place is a legend
they make the most powerful horrific weapons
to ever torment the universe
i would very much like to go there please
the rabbit is correct
and clearly the smartest among you
rabbit
only eitri the dwarf can make me the weapon i need
i assume youre the captain sir
youre very perceptive
you seem like a noble leader
will you join me on my quest to nidavellir
let me just ask the captain oh wait a second its me
 yeah ill go  wonderful
uh except for that im the captain
quiet
 thats my backpack  go sit down
look this is my ship
and im not goin to
wait what kinda weapon are we talkin about here
the thanoskilling kind
dont you think that we should all have a weapon like that
no you simply lack the strength to wield them
your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed into madness
is it weird that i wanna do it even more now
mmm a little bit yeah
if we dont go to knowhere
and thanos retrieves another stone
hell be too powerful to stop
 he already is  i got it figured out
we got two ships
and a large assortment of morons
so me and groot will go with the pirate angel here
and the morons will go to knowhere
to try to stop thanos
 cool cool  so cool
for the record
i know that youre going with him
because its where thanos isnt
you know you really shouldnt
talk that way to your captain quill
come on groot
put that game down youll rot your brain
i bid you farewell and good luck morons
bye
vis
is it the stone again
its as if its speaking to me
what does it say
i dont i dont know but something
 hey
tell me what you feel
i just feel you
so theres a 1000 am to glasgow
which would give us more time together before you went back
what if i miss that train
theres an 1100
what if i missed all the trains
what if this time i didnt go back
but you gave stark your word
id rather give it to you
well there are people who are expecting me too you know
we both made promises
not to each other
wanda
for two years weve stolen these moments
trying to see if this could work and
i dont know
you know what im just gonna speak for myself
i think
 it works  it works
it works
stay
stay with me
or not if im overstepping
what are they
what the stone was warning me about
i have to go
no vision
vision if thats true
then maybe going isnt the best idea
wanda i
 vision
the blade it stopped me from phasing
 is that even possible  it isnt supposed to be
my systems are failing
im beginning to think we should have stayed in bed
vis
give up the stone and she lives
hands off
come on come on
come on you gotta get up
you gotta get up come on hey
hey we have to go
please please leave
you asked me to stay
 im staying  please
 get up  i cant
we dont wanna kill you but we will
youll never get the chance again
can you stand
thank you captain
lets get you on the jet
now i thought we had a deal
stay close check in dont take any chances
im sorry
we just wanted time
where to cap
home
well be safe well be safe
zehobereians
mother wheres my mother
choose a side or die
mother
one side is a revelation
the other an honor known only to a few
whats wrong little one
my mother where is my mother
whats your name
gamora
youre quite the fighter gamora
come
let me help you
look
pretty isnt it
perfectly balanced as all things should be
too much to one side or the other
here you try
now go in peace to meet your maker
 uhuh
concentrate
there youve got it
gamora
do you know if these grenades
are the blowoffyourjunk kind or the gas kind
because i was thinking about
hanging a couple on my belt right here
but i dont want to if theyre the
i need to ask a favor
yeah sure
one way or another
the path that were on leads to thanos
which is what the grenades are for
uh im sorry whats the favor
if things go wrong
if thanos gets me
i want you to promise me
youll kill me
what
i know something he doesnt
and if he finds it out
the entire universe could be at risk
what do you know
if i tell you youd know too
if its so important
shouldnt i
only if you wanna die
why does somebody always have to die in this scenario
just
trust me and possibly kill me
i mean id like to
 i really would but you
swear to me
swear to me on your mother
okay
okay
 oh  dude
how long have you been standing there
an hour
an hour
are you serious
ive mastered the ability
of standing so incredibly still
that i become invisible to the eye
watch
youre eating a zargnut
but my movement
was so slow
that its imperceptible
mmm no
im sure im invisible
hi drax
damn it
this place looks deserted
im reading movement in the third quadrant
yep im picking that up too
lets put down right here
i dont have it
everyone in the galaxy knows
youd sell your own brother
if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket
to your pathetic collection
i know you have the reality stone tivan
giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering
i told you
i sold it
why would i lie
i imagine its like breathing for you
like suicide
you do understand
not even you would surrender something so precious
i didnt know what it was
then youre more of a fool than i took you for
its him
last chance charlatan
wheres the stone
today
drax drax
he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter
drax wait
not yet not yet not yet
drax
drax drax drax listen to me
he doesnt have the stone yet
if we get it then we can stop him
we have to get the stone first yeah
no
no for ovette for camaria
sleep
okay
gamora mantis you go right
the other right
why
why you daughter
that was quick
magnificent magnificent magnificent
is that sadness i sense in you daughter
in my heart i knew you still cared
but one never knows for sure
reality is often disappointing
that is it was
now
reality can be whatever i want
you knew id come
i counted on it
theres something we need to discuss little one
thanos
no
let her go grimace
peter
i told you to go right
now really
you let her go
 ah the boyfriend
no
like to think of myself
more as a titankilling longterm booty call
 let her go  peter
im gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face
not him
you promised you promised
oh daughter
you expect too much from him
shes asked hasnt she
do it
mmm
 do it
i told you to go right
i love you more than anything
i love you too
i like him
still no word from vision
satellites lost him somewhere over edinburgh
on a stolen quinjet
with four of the worlds most wanted criminals
you know theyre only criminals because
youve chosen to call them that right sir
my god rhodes
your talent for horseshit rivals my own
if it werent for those accords
vision wouldve been right here
i remember your signature on those papers colonel
thats right
and im pretty sure i paid for that
you have second thoughts
not anymore
mr secretary
you got some nerve
ill give you that
you could use some of that right now
the worlds on fire
and you think all is forgiven
im not looking for forgiveness
and im way past asking permission
earth just lost her best defender
so were here to fight
and if you wanna stand in our way
well fight you too
arrest them
all over it
thats a courtmartial
its great to see you cap
 you too rhodey
hey
wow you guys
really look like crap
mustve been a rough couple years
yeah well the hotels werent exactly five star
uh i think you look great
uh
yeah im back
hi bruce
nat
this is awkward
so we gotta assume theyre coming back right
and they can clearly find us
we need all hands on deck wheres clint
after the whole accords situation
he and scott took a deal it was too tough
on their families theyre on house arrest
 whos scott  antman
theres an antman and a spiderman
okay look
thanos has the biggest army in the universe
and he is not gonna stop until he gets
visions stone
then we have to protect it
no we have to destroy it
ive been giving a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head
about its nature
but also its composition
i think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently powerful energy source
something very similar to its own signature perhaps
its molecular integrity could fail
yeah and you with it
were not having this conversation
eliminating the stone is the only way
to be certain that thanos cant get it
thats too high a price
only you have the power to pay it
thanos threatens half the universe
one life cannot stand in the way of defeating him
but it should
we dont trade lives vision
captain 70 years ago you laid down your life
to save how many millions of people
tell me why is this any different
because you might have a choice
your mind is made up
of a complex construct of overlays
jarvis ultron tony me the stone
all of them mixed together
all of them learning from one another
youre saying vision isnt just the stone
im saying that if we take out the stone
theres still a whole lot of vision left
perhaps the best parts
can we do that
not me not here
well you better find someone
and somewhere fast
ross isnt just gonna let you guys
have your old rooms back
i know somewhere
the kingsguard
and the dora milaje have been alerted
and the border tribe
those that are left
send word to the jabari as well
mbaku likes a good fight
and what of this one
this one may be tired of war
but the white wolf has rested long enough
wheres the fight
on its way
in all the time ive served thanos
i have never failed him
if i were to reach our rendezvous on titan
with the time stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person
there would be judgment
give me
the stone
wow youre a seriously
loyal piece of outerwear arent you
yeah uh speaking of loyalty
what the
 i know what youre gonna say  you should not be here
 i was gonna go home  i dont wanna hear it
but it was such a long way down and i just thought
 about you on the way  and now i gotta hear it
and kinda stuck to the side of the ship
and this suit is ridiculously intuitive by the way
god damn it
so if anything its kinda your fault that im here
 what did you just say  i take that back
and now im here in space
yeah right where i didnt want you to be
this isnt coney island this isnt a field trip
this is a oneway ticket
you hear me dont pretend you thought this through
no i did think this through
you could not have possibly thought this through
you cant be a friendly neighborhood spiderman
if theres no neighborhood
okay that didnt really make sense
but you know what im trying to say
come on we got a situation
see him down there hes in trouble
whats your plan
 go  um
okay okay uh
okay did you ever see this really old movie aliens
painful arent they
they were originally designed for microsurgery
 and any one of them
could end your friends life in an instant
i gotta tell you hes not really my friend
saving his life is more of a professional courtesy
youve saved nothing
your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine
yeah but the kids seen more movies
yes wait what are those
hey we havent officially met
cool
we gotta turn this ship around
yeah now he wants to run great plan
no i want to protect the stone
and i want you to thank me
now go ahead im listening
for what nearly blasting me into space
who just saved your magical ass me
i seriously dont know
how you fit your head into that helmet
admit it you shouldve ducked out when i told you to
i tried to bench you you refused
unlike everyone else in your life i dont work for you
and due to that fact
were now in a flying doughnut
billions of miles from earth with no backup
 im backup  no youre a stowaway
the adults are talking
im sorry im confused as to the relationship here
what is he your ward
no
 im peter by the way  doctor strange
oh youre using our madeup names um
im spiderman then
this ship is selfcorrecting its course
things on autopilot
can we control it
fly us home
 stark  yeah
can you get us home
yeah i heard you
im thinking im not so sure we should
under no circumstances
can we bring the time stone to thanos
i dont think you quite understand
whats at stake here
what no its you who doesnt understand
that thanos has been inside my head for six years
since he sent an army to new york
and now hes back
and i dont know what to do
so im not so sure
if its a better plan to fight him on our turf or his
but you saw what they did what they can do
at least on his turf hes not expecting it
so i say we take the fight to him
doctor
do you concur
all right stark we go to him
but you have to understand
if it comes to saving you
or the kid or the time stone
i will not hesitate to let either of you die
i cant because the universe depends on it
nice good moral compass
were straight
all right kid
youre an avenger now
i thought you might be hungry
i always hated that chair
so ive been told
even so id hoped youd sit in it one day
i hated this room
this ship
i hated my life
you told me that too
every day
for almost 20 years
i was a child when you took me
i saved you
no
no we were happy on my home planet
going to bed hungry
scrounging for scraps
your planet was on the brink of collapse
im the one who stopped that
do you know whats happened since then
the children born
have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies
its a paradise
because you murdered half the planet
a small price to pay for salvation
youre insane
little one its a simple calculus
this universe is finite its resources finite
if life is left unchecked life will cease to exist
it needs correction
you dont know that
im the only one who knows that
at least im the only one with the will to act on it
for a time
you had that same will
as you fought by my side
daughter
im not your daughter
everything i hate about myself you taught me
and in doing so
made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy
thats why i trusted you to find the soul stone
im sorry i disappointed you
i am disappointed
but not because you didnt find it
but because you did
and you lied
nebula
dont do this
some time ago
your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me
please dont do this
and very nearly succeeded
so i brought her here
to talk
stop stop it
i swear to you on my life
i never found the soul stone
accessing memory files
you know what hes about to do
hes finally ready and hes going for the stones
 all of them  he can never get them all
he will
he cant nebula
because i found the map to the soul stone
and i burned it to ash i burned it
youre strong
me
youre generous
me
but i never taught you to lie
thats why youre so bad at it
where is the soul stone
vormir
the stone is on vormir
show me
i am groot
tinkle in the cup
were not looking whats there to see
whats a twig everybodys seen a twig before
i am groot
tree pour whats in the cup
out into space and go in the cup again
you speak groot
yes they taught it on asgard it was an elective
i am groot
youll know when were close
nidavellirs forge harnesses
the blazing power of a neutron star
its the birthplace of my hammer
its truly awesome
okay time to be the captain
so dead brother huh
yeah that could be annoying
well hes been dead before
but no this time i think it really might be true
and you said your sister and your dad
both dead
but still got a mom though
killed by a dark elf
a best friend
stabbed through the heart
you sure youre up to this particular murder mission
absolutely
rage and vengeance anger loss regret
theyre all tremendous motivators
they really clear the mind
so im good to go
yeah but this thanos were talkin about
hes the toughest there is
 well hes never fought me  yeah he has
hes never fought me twice
and im getting a new hammer dont forget
it better be some hammer
you know im 1500 years old
ive killed twice as many enemies as that
and every one of them wouldve rather killed me
but none succeeded
im only alive because fate wants me alive
thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards
and hell be the latest to feel my vengeance
fate wills it so
mmmhmm
and what if youre wrong
if im wrong then
what more could i lose
i could lose a lot
me personally i could lose a lot
okay
if fate does want you to kill that crapsack
youre gonna need more than one stupid eyeball
 whats this  whats it look like
some jerk lost a bet with me on contraxia
he gave you his eye
no he gave me 100 credits
i snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye
thank you sweet rabbit
hmm
huh
oh
i wouldve washed that
the only way i could sneak it off contraxia was up my
hey were here
i dont think this thing works
everything seems dark
it aint the eye
somethings wrong
the stars gone out
and the rings are frozen
i hope these dwarves are better
at forging than they are cleaning
maybe they realized that they live
in a junk pile in the middle of space
this forge hasnt gone dark in centuries
you said thanos had a gauntlet right
yes why
it look anything like that
i am groot
go back to the pod
eitri wait
stop
stop
thor
what happened here
you were supposed to protect us
asgard was supposed to protect us
asgard is destroyed
eitri the glove what did you do
300 dwarves lived on this ring
i thought if i did what he asked theyd be safe
i made what he wanted
a device capable of harnessing the power of the stones
then he killed everyone anyway
all except me
your life is yours he said
but your hands are mine alone
eitri this isnt about your hands
every weapon youve ever designed
every axe hammer sword
its all inside your head
now i know it feels like all hope is lost
trust me i know
but together you and i we can kill thanos
mantis listen very carefully
i need you to meet me on titan
hey whats going on
i think were here
i dont think this rig has a selfpark function
get your hand inside the steering gimbal

this was meant for one big guy so we gotta
 move at the same time  okay okay ready
 we might wanna turn
turn turn turn
you all right
that was close
i owe you one
let me just say if aliens

he took my girl wait who are you

you know thor
yeah
tall guy not that goodlooking needed saving
where is he now
this is the plan were gonna hit him with a brick
its a mold
a kings weapon
meant to be the greatest in asgard
in theory it could even summon the bifrost
did it have a name
stormbreaker
thats a bit much
so how do we make it
youll have to restart the forge
awaken the heart of a dying star
rabbit fire up the pod
the hell happened to this planet
its eight degrees off its axis
gravitational pull is all over the place
yeah we got one advantage hes coming to us
well use it all right i have a plan
or at least the beginnings of one
its pretty simple we draw him in
pin him down get what we need
definitely dont wanna dance with this guy
we just want the gauntlet
 are you yawning
in the middle of this while im breaking it down huh
did you hear what i said
i stopped listening after you said we need a plan
okay mr clean is on his own page
see not winging it isnt really what they do
uh what exactly is it that they do
kick names take ass
yeah thats right
all right just get over here please
mr lord can you get your folks to circle up
mr lord starlord is fine
we gotta coalesce
cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude
dude dont call us plucky
we dont know what it means
all right were optimistic yes i like your plan
except it sucks so let me do the plan
and that way it might be really good
tell him about the danceoff to save the universe
 what danceoff  its nothing
like in footloose the movie
exactly like footloose
is it still the greatest movie in history
it never was
dont encourage this all right
 okay  were getting no help
 from flash gordon here  flash gordon
by the way thats a compliment
dont forget im half human
so that 50 of me thats stupid
thats 100 you
your math is blowing my mind
excuse me
but does your friend often do that
strange we all right
youre back youre all right
 hi  hey what was that
i went forward in time to view alternate futures
to see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict
how many did you see
14000605
how many did we win
one
the stone had better be up there
for your sisters sake
welcome thanos son of alars
gamora daughter of thanos
you know us
it is my curse to know all who journey here
where is the soul stone
you should know
it extracts a terrible price
i am prepared
we all think that at first
we are all wrong
how is it you know this place so well
a lifetime ago i too sought the stones
i even held one in my hand
but it cast me out banished me here
guiding others to a treasure i cannot possess
what you seek lies in front of you
as does what you fear
whats this
the price
soul holds a special place among the infinity stones
you might say it has a certain wisdom
tell me what it needs
to ensure that whoever possesses it
understands its power
the stone demands a sacrifice
of what
in order to take the stone
you must lose that which you love
a soul
for a soul
all my life i dreamed of a day
a moment
when you got what you deserved
and i was always so disappointed
but now
you kill and torture
and you call it mercy
the universe has judged you
you asked it for a prize and it told you no
you failed
and do you wanna know why
because you love nothing
no one
no
really
tears
theyre not for him
no
this isnt love
i ignored my destiny once
i cannot do that again
even for you
im sorry little one
no
drop to 2600 heading 030
i hope youre right about this
or were gonna land a lot faster than you want to
when you said we were going to open wakanda
to the rest of the world
this is not what i imagined
and what did you imagine
the olympics

the structure is polymorphic
right we had to attach each neuron nonsequentially
why didnt you just reprogram
the synapses to work collectively
because we didnt think of it
im sure you did your best
can you do it
yes but there are more than two trillion neurons here
one misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures
it will take time brother
how long
as long as you can give me
somethings entered the atmosphere

he brought you facetoface
with the master of the mystic arts
and where do you think he brought you
let me guess your home
it was
and it was beautiful
titan was like most planets
too many mouths not enough to go around
and when we faced extinction i offered a solution
genocide
but random dispassionate fair to rich and poor alike
they called me a madman
and what i predicted came to pass
congratulations youre a prophet
im a survivor
who wants to murder trillions
with all six stones i could simply snap my fingers
they would all cease to exist i call that mercy
and then what
id finally rest
and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe
the hardest choices require the strongest wills
